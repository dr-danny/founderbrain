/**
 * app/content/content-pin.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The guard that holds `vendor/growth-engine/` to the commit
 * `vendor/content-pin.json` names, and the proof that the guard can actually
 * fail.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * The content moved from a git submodule to ordinary committed files so that a
 * founder's fork or Replit remix carries it without fetching a private
 * repository. That removed a failure in a room of 65 people and introduced a
 * quieter one: the originals `app/tests/skill-diff.test.ts` compares the ported
 * prose against are now writeable. Editing the original instead of the port
 * makes both sides agree, the drift test go green, and nobody is told. This
 * test closes that. It also catches a vendored file edited for any other
 * reason, a lost execute bit on `bin/ge`, a symlink pointing the originals at
 * somebody's own checkout, and a pin edited by hand to match.
 *
 * A test that only ever passes proves nothing, so half of what is below builds
 * a small tree on purpose, breaks it in each of those ways, and checks the
 * verifier goes red.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * `npm test`. It sits beside its module rather than in `app/tests/` because
 * that is where the rest of `app/content/` and `src/server/rules/` keep theirs.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS
 * `vendor/content-pin.json`, `vendor/growth-engine/`, and temporary trees it
 * builds under the system temp directory.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES
 * Only those temporary trees, and it removes them.
