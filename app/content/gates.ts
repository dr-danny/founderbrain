/**

 * Regenerate with: npx tsx app/content/gen-gates.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The three gates and the file table, as typed data.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * The gates screen, the status skill's checklist and a mentor's list all have
 * to say the same thing. `schemas/gates.md` is the one source and `ge index`
 * reads it directly. This is that same file, parsed, so the app reads the same
 * answers rather than a second copy somebody typed. `app/tests/gates.test.ts`
 * re-parses the markdown and fails if this file has drifted from it.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * The gates screen, the run context header, and anything that needs to know
 * which gate a file counts towards.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Nothing. It is data.
