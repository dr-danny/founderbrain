/**
 * app/content/ghl-walk.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * Every string in the GoHighLevel token walk. Six screens, the success page,
 * the failure table, and the revoke notice.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * This is the hardest thing a non-technical founder does in the whole
 * programme, and the words are the part that decides whether they get through
 * it. Copy that lives inside components gets edited by whoever is nearest the
 * component, at the moment they are thinking about layout. Here it can be read
 * end to end, out loud, by somebody who has never opened the code, and changed
 * without touching a line of logic. Every screen names the founder's doubt
 * first, answers it, and ends on one action, because a founder who is unsure
 * whether they are about to do something dangerous stops and posts in Slack.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * The setup wizard screens, the verifier's failure rendering, and the mentor
 * board, which prints the evidence strings below word for word.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Nothing. It is data. The seven scopes, the token prefix and the two menu
 * routes are imported from the contracts directory and are never written out
 * again here.
 *
 * WHAT IS UNVERIFIED, AND STAYS THAT WAY UNTIL THE SPIKES RUN
 * Four things, each marked at its use below. Which status code GoHighLevel
 * returns for a scope refusal. Whether a real token starts with the prefix we
 * check for. The name of the contacts read. And where GoHighLevel keeps the two
 * screens a founder has to reach. Nothing here invents an endpoint, a field or a
 * status code.
 *
 * HOW THE COPY HANDLES A MENU THAT HAS MOVED
 * A vendor moves a menu item whenever it likes, and nobody on this project has
 * opened that menu. So no sentence here states a route as a fact. Each one says
 * when we last looked, then says what to search the page for, and the hard stop
 * on step 2 names both causes rather than telling a founder their plan is wrong
 * when the truth may be that a screen moved. The rest of the walk points at
 * where the founder has already been, which is the one instruction a menu change
 * cannot break.

 * they are filled in, with nobody having to notice. A boolean maintained by hand here
 * would be a fourth place that has to agree with the other three.

 *
 * WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS TRUE. One thing, and it is small: what
 * `GET /social-media-posting/{locationId}/accounts` actually returns. The workflow
