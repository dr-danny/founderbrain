/**
 * app/content/routes.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The routing table. Every skill, how a founder reaches it, what it needs
 * first, and which track it belongs to. Also the one place `Track` and `Model`
 * are turned into a route name.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Rule 1 says the fork happens once, in the Founder Brain, and every later step
 * reads it. In the plugin that was a sentence the model was trusted to obey:
 * `commands/engine2.md` said "check the track field" and hoped. Here it is a
 * server side filter on this table, so a B2C founder has no row that could
 * start the B2B engine. The other track's rows are absent, not greyed out.
 *
 * It also settles F3 in `planning/REPLIT-BUILD.md` section 9. Two vocabularies
 * describe one fork: `schemas/brain.md` stores `Track` of b2b or b2c and
 * `Model` of service or ecommerce, while `planning/delivery/00-scope.md:62`
 * names three routes, b2b, b2c-service and b2c-ecom. `routeFor()` below is the
 * only code that maps between them. Nothing else computes it.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * The sidebar, the intent router, the gates screen, the run assembler that
 * builds the run context header, and the snapshot chooser.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Nothing. It is data plus two pure functions.
 *
 * SOURCES
 * Subtitles are the `description:` lines of `plugins/growth-engine/commands/`,
 * lifted unchanged except where noted. Phrases are the trigger phrases already
 * written into the nine skill descriptions, lifted unchanged. File names come
 * from `app/content/gates.md`, and a test asserts the two agree.

   * was nothing on the screen to answer, so the only honest reading of it was that
   * something had failed to load.

   * IT IS AN INVITATION, NOT A SCRIPT. A founder who types something else is not wrong,
