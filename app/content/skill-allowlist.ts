/**
 * app/content/skill-allowlist.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The section 3 adaptation table of `planning/REPLIT-BUILD.md`, written out so
 * a test can hold it. One row per difference between a ported skill body and
 * its original in the public content repo.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Without it, "we only changed about 40 lines" is a claim nobody can check.
 * With it, any other change fails the build. The failure it prevents is prose
 * drift: a founder-facing sentence edited here, never reviewed in the public
 * repo, shipped to 130 people. It also catches the reverse, an upstream edit
 * arriving with a re-vendored copy and silently not reaching the app.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * `app/content/skill-diff.ts`, and through it `app/tests/skill-diff.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Nothing. It is data.
 *
 * HOW TO CHANGE A SKILL BODY
 * Edit the prose in the public content repo first. Then bring it in here:
 *   npm run engine:bump -- --to <ref> --from <a checkout of the content repo>
 * That is the only supported way, and it prints what moved before it moves it.
 * Then, if the app's copy has to differ, add a row here with the group it
 * belongs to and the reason, and only then edit the file under `skills/`.
 * A row that matches nothing fails too, so a rule cannot outlive its change.
