/**
 * app/tests/content-prose.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The house style and product rules, applied to every string in
 * `app/content/` that a founder can end up reading.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * `scripts/validate.sh` in the content repo checks files a human wrote, before
 * a commit. None of it reaches this repo, and these strings are the ones a
 * founder reads on the hardest screen in the programme. The rules that were
 * enforced there have to be enforced here or they are not enforced at all. The
 * banned word list and the dash rule below are the ones from
 * `scripts/validate.sh:244-271`, imported rather than reinvented.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS
 * The exported values of `routes.ts`, `scopes.ts`, `ghl-walk.ts` and
 * `gates.ts`. It walks the real objects rather than the source text, so a
 * comment explaining a rule is not mistaken for a breach of it.
 *
 * `gates.md` is deliberately not checked. It is a byte-for-byte port of a
 * maintainer's schema, it says so in its own words at line 148, and the test
 * that matters for it is the one asserting it is identical to the original.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES
 * Nothing.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN
 *   node --import tsx --test app/tests/content-prose.test.ts
