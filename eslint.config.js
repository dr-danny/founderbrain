/**
 * eslint.config.js
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The lint rules. Most of it is ordinary TypeScript linting. Four rules are
 * not ordinary, and those four are the reason this file has a header comment.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The build document puts four safety properties in code rather than in
 * prose, because a rule that lives in a document is a rule somebody breaks in a hurry on
 * the Thursday of the fix window:
 *
 *   1. `shell: true` never appears anywhere. ge is spawned with an argv array, so anything
 *      a founder types arrives as one argument and cannot be read as shell. That is the
 *      injection boundary and it is one property on one call.
 *   2. process.env is read in exactly one place per product surface: src/server/env.ts for
 *      Launchhouse, src/founderbrain/config.ts for FounderBrain. Anywhere else and a
 *      missing variable is found at 3am instead of at boot.
 *   3. fetch against a vendor happens in exactly one function per surface. Launchhouse uses
 *      src/server/integrations/http.ts; FounderBrain uses src/founderbrain/provider.ts.
 *   4. Inside the GoHighLevel modules, nothing formats a date except the one conversion
 *      function. The founder means 09:30 where they are. If any other file reaches for
 *      toISOString, a post lands at the wrong hour for 130 people.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. `npm run lint`, and the editor.
 *
 * These rules point at files that do not all exist yet. That is deliberate: the rule lands
 * before the code it governs, so the first version of that code is written under it.
 *
 * WHY TEST FILES ARE EXEMPT FROM RULE 2, AND ONLY FROM RULE 2. A test that sets
 * WORKSPACE_ROOT to a temporary directory in beforeEach and puts the old value back in
 * afterEach is not bypassing the boot check. It IS the boot check's test: it is the only
 * way to prove that a founder folder really moves when an operator moves it, and that a
 * bad value is refused. The alternative considered was a helper that tests call instead,
 * and it was rejected: a helper is a second door into process.env, the rule cannot see
 * through it, and the day somebody imports the helper from a route there is nothing left
 * to catch it. An exemption is visible in this file; a helper is invisible in fifty.
 *
 * The exemption is exactly one rule wide. shell: true stays banned in test files, because
 * a test is where a spawn gets copied from. Rules 3 and 4 come off in tests for the same
 * reason as rule 2: a test double for a vendor call has to be able to build a date and
 * stand in for a fetch.
