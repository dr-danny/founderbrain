 *
 * WHAT: Turns one tool call into one line a founder can read. `Read
 *       growth-engine/founder-brain.md` becomes "reading your Founder Brain".
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: A founder watching nothing happen for 40 seconds while the
 *       model reads three files concludes the app is broken and messages a
 *       mentor. There are 130 of them and three days. So tool activity is
 *       forwarded, and it is forwarded as plain English, because raw tool JSON
 *       on the screen of a non technical founder is worse than silence.
 *
 * CALLED BY: runner.ts, on every tool_use block and every PostToolUse hook.
 * READS:  nothing. WRITES: nothing. Pure functions.
 *
 * Two rules hold here and both are deliberate.
 *   Nothing from tool input reaches the founder except a file path that
 *   matched the known file list. A model writing a prospect's email address
 *   into a Grep pattern must not put it on a status line, and from there into
 *   a screenshot in a room with 130 people in it.
 *   An unknown tool gets a vague line, never its name and never its input. The
 *   tool surface is frozen, so an unknown tool is a deploy bug, and a founder
 *   is not the right person to read the stack trace.
