/**
 * runner.ts
 *
 * WHAT: THE LOOP. One AgentRun owns one query() from the Claude Agent SDK, for
 *       one founder and one thread, and turns every message that comes out of
 *       it into something a browser can render.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: Everything else in this folder decides what should happen.
 *       This is the only file that makes it happen, and it is the only file
 *       that touches the SDK. Three failures live here and nowhere else.
 *       A founder watching a blank screen for 40 seconds and concluding the
 *       app is broken: solved by streaming partial messages and by translating
 *       tool calls into English. A founder unable to stop a run that has gone
 *       wrong: solved by interrupt. A loop that bills the whole cohort's
 *       allowance at 3 am: solved by the cap that the SDK enforces inside the
 *       loop rather than after a poll.
 *
 * CALLED BY: session-pool.ts, which owns the lifetime of these objects, and
 *       through it the route layer.
 * READS:  the skill bodies and run facts, through assemble.ts. WRITES: nothing
 *       durable itself. It emits TurnEvents; the caller persists them as
 *       turn_events rows and writes the spend row through Budget.
 *
 * THE TOOL SURFACE HAS NO SHELL, AND IT IS SET IN THREE PLACES ON PURPOSE.
 *   `tools`            the base set of built in tools. Named, never a preset.
 *   `allowedTools`     what runs without asking. The same names, plus our two.
 *   `disallowedTools`  Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Task and Skill, removed from
 *                      the model's context even if something above let them in.
 * Any one of the three would probably do. All three are set because
 * `permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions'` is only safe BECAUSE of three things
 * together: there is no shell, cwd is a per founder scratch directory, and a
 * PreToolUse hook (hooks.ts, preToolUse) refuses any Read, Write, Edit, Glob
 * or Grep whose path resolves outside that founder's own folder. cwd alone
 * does not stop a tool being handed an absolute path, which is why the third
 * thing exists. If any of the three ever changes, the permission mode has to
 * change with it. A default is not a decision, and the failure this prevents
 * is a model with a shell, or an unfenced absolute path, inside a folder
 * holding 3,000 real people's contact details.
 *
 * WHY `tools` IS SET AT ALL, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Asked for nothing,
 * CLI 2.1.250 hands the model 29 tools, and that list contains Bash, Task,
 * WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill, SendMessage and CronCreate. The named list is
 * what turns 29 into 5.
 *
 * Note what is not confused here. The MODEL has no shell. The SERVER spawns ge
 * itself, as a child process, with an argv array, in src/server/ge/run.ts. Two
 * different things, and both hold.

   * ON THE 16 BUNDLED SKILLS, MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. This used to refuse when
   * `msg.skills` was non empty, on the reasoning that `skills: []` plus
   * `settingSources: []` should mean nothing was discovered. Spawning the real
   * CLI says otherwise. `msg.skills` comes back with the same 16 names under
   * every value of the option: `[]`, `['code-review']`, `'all'`, and omitted.
   * It is a DISCOVERY list, reporting what the CLI found bundled inside its own
   * binary, and it is invariant. It was never an enabled list, so the old
   * assertion was reading the wrong field.
   *
   * Is a discovered skill a risk? A skill is a page of instructions. It cannot
   * add a tool, so it cannot give the model a shell, the network or a subagent.
   * The first rule is untouched. Nor can it reach the founder's work: a skill is
   * only ever loaded through the Skill tool, and Skill is not in the surface.
   * Measured on 2.1.250: the tool list is Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep and the
   * ge tools, with no Skill under any `skills` value, because the explicit
   * `tools` array decides the surface. Asked for by name, Skill does appear,
   * which is how we know its absence is our doing and not luck.
   *
   * So the mitigation is not a new one. It is the same named `tools` array that
   * removes Bash, now written down as an assertion: Skill is in FORBIDDEN_TOOLS.
   * If a future CLI or a bad deploy puts Skill back in the surface, the turn is
   * refused, which is the guarantee `skills: []` could not give us.
   *
   * What remains true and is worth saying plainly: those skill files sit on
   * disk and Read is in the surface, so the model could in principle read one.
   * Reading a page of instructions is not an escalation, we did not write those
   * files, and no founder data is in them.
