/**
 * test-fixtures.ts
 *
 * WHAT: A routing table, a founder context, a collecting logger, and the real
 *       CLI's system/init message, for tests.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: This folder is built before app/content/routes.ts, and it must
 *       stay testable after that file exists without importing it. Every unit
 *       here takes its routing table as an argument, so this fixture is what
 *       the tests pass. It is shaped from the nine real skills so the tests are
 *       about the real fork and not an invented one.
 *
 *       IT IS NOT THE ROUTING TABLE. app/content/routes.ts is, and it is owned
 *       by the content side of the build. If the two ever disagree about which
 *       tracks a row belongs to, that file wins and this one is the bug.
 *
 * CALLED BY: the *.test.ts files in this folder. Nothing in production.

 * suite stays green over a CLI that does not exist. That is not a hypothetical:
 * a fake with TodoWrite in the tool list and an empty skills list is what let a
 * bug through that refused every turn, for every founder, on every route, while
 * the suite passed.
 *
 * Verified on 2026-08-29 against @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk 0.3.250, whose
 * bundled CLI reports claude_code_version 2.1.250.
 *
 * Re measure with `npm run prove:init`. It spawns the real CLI with runner.ts's
 * own options, reads the first system/init off the wire, and prints it. If it
 * disagrees with what is below, what is below is the bug.
