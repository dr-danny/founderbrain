/**
 * src/server/auth/owner.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Owner sign in driven directly, without a server: readiness,
 * the claim, the refusals, and the two limits.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. This is the whole of the protection on a single tenant app
 * published at a guessable web address. The tests that matter here are the ones
 * that prove a guard FAILS, not the ones that prove it passes. A limit nobody
 * has watched refuse is a limit nobody has tested, and it reads in a review
 * exactly like one that works.
 *
 * So every guard in ./owner.ts is exercised from the refusing side first:
 * readiness refuses three different bad passphrases, the per client limit
 * refuses the eleventh try, the slow down is asked for and its size is checked,
 * and a wrong passphrase is shown to create no owner row at all.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. ./owner.ts and ./rate-limit.ts against the in memory store.
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing outside the process.
