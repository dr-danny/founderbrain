/**
 * src/server/auth/plugin.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The HTTP surface of sign in, and the door every other route in
 * this app sits behind.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. It is the one place a request becomes the founder. The session
 * cookie is read here and nowhere else, and no handler anywhere reads a founder
 * id from a body, a query string or a path.
 *
 * THE DOOR IS SHUT BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT MATTERS MOST IN THIS
 * FILE. There used to be one `requireFounder` that each route had to remember to
 * call. That is a design where a new route is open until somebody notices, and
 * the thing on the other side of it is one founder's customer list, their
 * credentials and their files, on a public web address. So there is an
 * onRequest hook now: every path under `/api/` is refused unless a session
 * resolves, whatever the route does or does not call. `requireFounder` still
 * exists and still works, and it now reuses what the hook already looked up
 * rather than reading the session twice.
 *
 * The other failures it prevents:
 *
 *   AN UNCONFIGURED DEPLOYMENT SERVING THE APP. With no usable
 *   OWNER_PASSPHRASE, every request is answered with the screen that says which
 *   Replit Secret to set. Not the app, not an empty sign in box that can never
 *   succeed. It refuses whether or not anybody called the boot guard in
 *   ./owner.ts, because a guard that depends on a caller remembering is one
 *   refactor from being decorative.
 *
 *   A FORM POST FASTIFY CANNOT PARSE. Fastify parses JSON out of the box and
 *   nothing else. The sign in screen is a plain HTML form on purpose, so it
 *   works with JavaScript switched off and before dist/web exists, and a form
 *   posts urlencoded. Without the parser registered here the founder would
 *   press a button that did nothing.
 *
 *   THE BINDING SECRET BEING PASSED IN BY HAND. `SessionConfig.bindingSecret`
 *   is what makes changing the passphrase sign every device out. It is built
 *   HERE, from the passphrase, rather than accepted from the caller, so there
 *   is no way for src/server/index.ts to wire a value that is merely plausible
 *   and quietly lose the property.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. src/server/index.ts registers it once, before the API routes.
 * WHAT IT READS. The cookie on the request, and the AuthStore.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. The owner row on first claim, `sessions` and `ge_event`
 * through the store, and one Set-Cookie header.
