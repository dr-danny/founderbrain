/**
 * src/server/auth/session.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The session cookie's arithmetic: what a cookie resolves to,
 * when it stops resolving, when the expiry slides, and what a changed
 * passphrase does to every device at once.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Every one of these is a failure that reads to the founder as
 * "the app forgot me", on a morning when nobody can stop to help. The expiry is
 * 90 days on purpose, so the test that matters most is the one that proves a
 * founder who signed in on 4 September is still signed in on the 25th.
 *
 * AND ONE OF THEM IS A SECURITY PROPERTY RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE. Changing
 * OWNER_PASSPHRASE has to end every live session, or a founder who thinks
 * somebody got in changes it, is told the app is safe, and the stranger's
 * cookie still works. That is the last test in this file and it is the reason
 * `sessionIdFor` exists.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. ./session.ts against the in memory store.
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing outside the process.
