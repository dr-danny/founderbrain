/**
 * src/server/boot/readiness.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Tests for src/server/boot/readiness.ts, driven through a real Fastify
 * instance rather than by calling the hook directly.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. This file replaced four `process.exit(1)` calls. An exit is crude and it
 * is unambiguous: nothing runs afterwards. What replaced it is a hook, and a hook can be
 * registered in the wrong place, match the wrong paths, or quietly not fire at all, and all
 * three of those look identical to a working gate in a code review. So the gates are driven
 * with real requests through `app.inject`, and the two that matter most are asserted from
 * both sides: the route that must be refused IS refused, and the route that must keep
 * working DOES keep working.
 *
 * THE ONE THAT WOULD BE EASY TO GET WRONG. Refusing every POST while the Anthropic key is
 * missing would lock a founder out of the setup screen, which is the only screen that can
 * fix the missing key. There is a test below whose entire job is to notice that.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. Nothing outside itself. WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing.
