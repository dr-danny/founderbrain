/**
 * src/server/boot/readiness.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The list of things that are missing, in words a founder can act on, plus
 * the screen that shows the list and the gate that refuses work while it stands.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Boot used to answer one question, "may this process start", and it
 * answered by exiting. Every one of those exits was correct for one deployment we operated
 * and wrong for 130 deployments a founder operates. On Replit an exit is a container that
 * restarts for ever behind a URL that never answers. The founder sees a blank page. Nobody
 * in the room can tell a missing database from a missing key from a crashed process,
 * because all three look the same.
 *
 * So the process starts, and this file answers a different question: WHAT IS MISSING, AND
 * WHAT DOES THE PERSON DO ABOUT IT. Three parts, and they are here together on purpose,
 * because the day they drift is the day the screen says one thing and the gate does another:
 *
 *   1. blockersFrom() turns the boot facts into a list. Pure, so it is tested directly.
 *   2. startHerePage() renders that list. Server rendered, so it works before the browser
 *      bundle has been built and with JavaScript switched off.
 *   3. ReadinessState plus the two gates refuse work while anything is on the list.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED IS STILL THE RULE. Nothing here makes the app more permissive. A missing
 * database used to stop the process; now it stops every API request with a sentence, and
 * the founder can read the sentence. A missing engine used to stop the process; now it
 * stops turns. In both cases the amount of founder work that can be silently lost is the
 * same, which is none, and the amount they can understand went from nothing to all of it.
 *
 * THE PASSPHRASE IS ON THE LIST AND IS NOT ONE OF THE GATES. auth/plugin.ts already answers
 * every request with its own screen when OWNER_PASSPHRASE is unusable, and it does that
 * better than a general page could. It is listed here so that a founder who is missing three
 * things reads three things in one place, and `handledElsewhere` is what stops this file
 * taking over a screen that belongs to auth.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. src/server/index.ts, in main() and in buildServer(). Its own test.
 * WHAT IT READS. What it is handed, plus one file test: browserBundleIsBuilt() below asks
 * the disk whether dist/web/index.html exists, and only when a caller asks it to.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. Replies, and its own state.

 * Put the gates on. Called from buildServer BEFORE any route is registered, because a
 * Fastify hook applies to routes registered after it and to nothing before it.
 *
 * THREE HOOKS, NOT ONE, because they refuse different things for different reasons:
 *
 *   The first answers GET / with the start page. It is the property this whole change is
 *   about: boot with nothing set, reach a screen, be told what to do.
 *   The second refuses every API request when the record is unreachable. A request that
 *   cannot read or write the record cannot do anything true.
 *   The third refuses the two routes that start a turn when the engine or the key is
 *   missing. A turn started without either produces "That one did not finish", which reads
 *   to a founder as the app being broken rather than as a thing they can fix.
