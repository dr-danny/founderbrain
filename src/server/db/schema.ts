/**
 * src/server/db/schema.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The Drizzle definition of every table in the Launchhouse database. Postgres is
 *   the record. The container filesystem is a cache and is not durable, so if a
 *   fact is not in one of these tables it does not exist.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   It prevents the failure named in build doc section 2: a founder finishes a turn,
 *   the container dies, and their work is gone because it only ever lived in /tmp.
 *   It also prevents the failure that ends the product, one founder reading another
 *   founder's prospects: every founder owned table carries founder_id in its primary
 *   key or as its first index column, and the migration puts row level security on
 *   the four tables where a leak would be worst.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 *   src/server/storage/* (blobs, materialise, harvest, turn), src/server/db/client.ts,
 *   and every route and agent module that reads state. Nothing writes founder files
 *   directly: writes go through storage/turn.ts.
 *
 * READS  nothing
 * WRITES nothing. It is a declaration. Migrations under db/migrations/ apply it.
 *
 * THE TABLES IN THE BUILD DOC ARE COPIED, NOT REDESIGNED. Section 5 gives DDL for
 * founder, ge_file, ge_file_version, ge_blob and ge_event. Those five are transcribed
 * column for column. The app layer tables are named in section 5 but have no DDL
 * there, so their columns are derived from what sections 4, 6 and 7 say they hold.
 * Each of those carries a comment naming the section it came from.
 *
 * TWO TABLES ARE IN NEITHER LIST, and both are named here rather than left to be found.
 * `mentor_requests` is not in the build document. Section 6 describes the screen it
 * serves ("The second writes into a mentor queue") and never says where that queue
 * lives, and the answer it was given was a log line. The table is what makes the
 * sentence on that screen true. Its own comment carries the reasoning.
 *
 * `storage_limit_overrides` is also not in the build document: it is what lets the
 * owner set their own three storage limits from the Setup screen, in front of
 * `storage/paths.ts`'s `storageLimits()`, which predates it. Its own comment carries
 * the reasoning.
 *
 * NAMING NOTE. Section 5's DDL says `create table founder` (singular) and its prose
 * says `founders.track`. The SQL wins, because it is the part that has to compile.
 * The SQL table is `founder`; the exported binding is `founders` because every other
 * binding here is plural; `founder` is exported as an alias so code written from
 * either half of the doc compiles.

 * the entire content of the request. There is nothing else about this person that we

 * the person, so the board can show what is still outstanding and a second press
 * does not read as a second person. Both stay null until that board exists.

/**
 * One settings row, for the whole app, never one per founder.
 *
 * This is app configuration, not founder data. `storage/paths.ts`'s `storageLimits()`
 * already resolves these three numbers from an env override or from what the host
 * detects; this table adds a third, higher-precedence source — the owner's own choice
 * on the Setup screen — and it is a property of the deployment, not of any one founder
 * in it. Reusing `founder_id` here the way every other table does would say the
 * opposite: that a second founder could set their own separate ceiling on the one disk
 * they all share.
 *
 * `id` is pinned to the single literal `'owner'` by a CHECK in the migration, so a
 * fresh row can never be inserted under a different key. A settings module that reads
 * "the" row by primary key must never find two, and a broken upsert target is exactly
 * the kind of bug a CHECK turns into a failed write instead of a row nobody reads.
 *
 * EACH LIMIT IS INDEPENDENTLY NULLABLE. Null means "the owner has not set this one",
 * which falls through to GE_LIMIT_* or to detection exactly as if this row did not
 * exist. Bytes are stored in the same units `storageLimits()` already returns them in
 * — plain bytes, not MiB or GiB — so nothing here or in limits-store.ts ever converts.
 *
 * bigint, NOT integer: Postgres's `integer` tops out at about 2.1 GB, and this app's
 * own detection ceiling for total-bytes is 5 GiB (see `CEIL_TOTAL_BYTES` in paths.ts).
 * An owner asking for more than that gets clamped by limits-store.ts before this row
 * is ever written, but the raw, unclamped number the owner typed is what is stored —
 * see limits-store.ts for why — and that number must never overflow the column.
 *
 * NO founder_id, AND NO ROW LEVEL SECURITY POLICY, for the same reason `mentor_requests`
 * carries neither: a policy filters on `app.founder_id` and there is nothing here to
 * filter on. The guard is the same one that table relies on: nothing a founder reaches
 * through the ordinary app surface ever queries this table for anyone else's data,
 * because there is no one else's data in it.
