/**
 * src/server/env.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The one place the process reads its environment. Every variable is named,
 * typed and checked here, and nowhere else in the server calls process.env.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT THE REASON IT USED TO BE.
 *
 * This file was written for ONE deployment serving 130 founders. In that shape a missing
 * variable was an operator's mistake, the operator was us, and the cheapest possible
 * failure was a process that refused to start with one line naming the variable. Thirteen
 * variables were required and every refusal was correct.
 *
 * The shape changed. There are now 130 deployments, one per founder, each one remixed into
 * a founder's own Replit account and set up by that founder in a staffed room. The
 * operator is a non technical person with a laptop open and sixty four other people in the
 * same room. For them a refusal to boot is not one readable line. It is a blank page, a
 * container that restarts for ever, and a stall that costs the room rather than costing
 * them.
 *
 * So the rule inverted. NOTHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS REQUIRED ANY MORE. The app boots with
 * an empty environment, binds a port, serves a page, and that page says what is missing and
 * what to do about it. There is exactly one thing a founder must supply, an Anthropic API
 * key, and they paste it into the running app rather than into a settings pane. A key that
 * is pasted into the app cannot also be required to start the app, which is the whole
 * reason ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is optional below.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE. A value that is present and WRONG still stops the process. A cap
 * that reads "two dollars fifty" is not a cap. A DATABASE_ENV_TAG that disagrees with
 * APP_ENV is a process holding the wrong connection string. Absent is now a default or a
 * warning. Malformed is still a refusal, and the boot report still lists every problem at
 * once so fixing them takes one restart and not four.
 *
 * It also holds three checks that are not really about variables at all, and they are here
 * because this is the only code guaranteed to run before anything else:
 *
 *   - The process clock is UTC. Every date in the system is UTC or an IANA zone name
 *     carried beside it. A server that quietly runs in some other zone puts a founder's
 *     ops-log entry under the wrong day heading, and ops-log.md is append only. This one
 *     is still fatal, and it cannot fire on the founder path: package.json's own start
 *     script sets TZ=UTC, and package.json is copied by a Replit remix.
 *   - Full ICU is present, so America/New_York resolves. A slim Node build does not know
 *     that zone, and every scheduled post depends on it.
 *   - No ambient vendor credential exists. There is no GHL_TOKEN and no Apollo key at
 *     process level, by design. A vendor credential with no founder attached to it is how
 *     one founder's post ends up in another founder's account. Still fatal. It is not an
 *     absence, it is a wrong thing being present.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE ANY MORE, AND WHY. GE_MASTER_KEY has left the Env object. It is
 * resolved AFTER the database answers, by src/server/boot/master-key.ts, because a single
 * tenant app generates its own key on first boot and keeps it where a redeploy cannot lose
 * it. A value that is settled after the database is reached cannot live on an object that
 * is frozen before the database is reached, and leaving an empty string there is how a
 * caller ends up signing a cookie with nothing. installMasterKey below is the one seam
 * that puts the resolved key where storage/crypto.ts already looks for it.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. src/server/index.ts, first thing, before Fastify is constructed. Tests
 * call parseEnv directly, which is why parseEnv throws and only loadEnv exits.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. process.env. Nothing else.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing. It returns a frozen object, and it may end the process.

//
// WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS. Five modules need a value at the moment they are called rather
// than once at startup: ge/run.ts decides which binary to spawn and under which shell,
// storage/paths.ts turns a founder id into a directory, storage/crypto.ts holds a keyring
// that a rotation adds to, db/client.ts sizes the pool, and rules/content-root.ts finds
// the content repo. Each of them read process.env itself, so each carried its own default
// and its own idea of what a bad value meant. A GE_SHELL typo found inside ge/run.ts is
// found at a founder's first turn, on the tenancy critical path. The same typo found here
// stops the process before it serves anything.
//
// So the reading and the checking happen once, here, and those modules call lateSettings().
// parseEnv runs the same check at boot. A process that never called loadEnv, meaning a test
// or a one off script, gets the same check on every call instead: same schema, same
// defaults, same refusal, later. One place to look, one set of numbers.
//
// THE KEYRING IS NOW WRITABLE ONCE, through installMasterKey. See its header.
