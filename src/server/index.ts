/**
 * src/server/index.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The process. It reads the environment, builds one Fastify
 * instance, wires sign in and the API to Postgres, serves the built browser
 * bundle, binds a port, and shuts down without dropping a founder mid sentence.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, and the order in it is the file.
 *
 *   loadEnv() IS THE FIRST STATEMENT. Before Fastify, before the database,
 *   before anything is imported for its side effects. Everything the process
 *   is allowed to believe about its configuration is settled on that line.
 *
 *   IT NO LONGER REFUSES TO START, AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN THIS FILE.
 *   This process used to exit for a missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, a missing
 *   database, a missing ge, and eleven other things. Every one of those exits
 *   was right for ONE deployment that we operated. There are now 130, one per
 *   founder, each in the founder's own Replit account, set up by that founder
 *   in a room with sixty four other people in it. An exit there is not a
 *   readable line of output. It is a container that restarts for ever behind a
 *   URL that never answers, and a blank page that cannot tell a missing
 *   database from a missing key.
 *
 *   So main() now GATHERS rather than exits. Each check returns a fact, the
 *   facts become a list of blockers in boot/readiness.ts, the list becomes the
 *   first screen a founder sees, and every route that could act on missing
 *   state is refused with the same words that are on that screen. Nothing got
 *   more permissive: a turn with no engine behind it is still refused, and an
 *   API call with no database behind it is still refused. What changed is that
 *   a founder can now read why.
 *
 *   WHAT STILL EXITS. Two things, and both are a wrong thing being present
 *   rather than a missing thing. A value that is set and unusable, which
 *   env.ts reports and exits on. And assertContractsReady, which throws when a
 *   switched on feature rests on a vendor detail no spike has verified. That is
 *   a mistake in this repository, not a condition of the founder's machine.
 *
 *   THE MASTER KEY IS RESOLVED HERE, AFTER THE DATABASE ANSWERS. It used to be
 *   a Replit Secret we set by hand. A founder cannot be asked to generate 32
 *   random bytes, so boot/master-key.ts finds or makes one and keeps it where a
 *   redeploy cannot lose it. Read that file before changing this order: the key
 *   has to be installed before anything signs a cookie or opens a blob.
 *
 *   THE BOOT ASSERTIONS ARE CALLED HERE, WHICH IS NEW. Two of them said in
 *   their own headers that this file called them and it did not:
 *   `assertContractsReady`, the check that refuses to start when a switched on
 *   feature rests on a vendor detail no spike has verified, and
 *   `assertGeInterface`, the one spawn that proves ge honours the GE_HOME pin.
 *   Both are in `main()` now, before anything binds a port. A guard with no
 *   caller reads in a review exactly like a guard that runs, which is the worst
 *   property a guard can have.
 *
 *   THE DATABASE IS BUILT HERE, BEFORE THE PORT BINDS, AND THAT IS NEW. Nothing
 *   ran the migration. `.replit` runs `npm run start`, the deployment build
 *   command is `npm ci && npm run build`, and `npm run db:migrate` was in
 *   neither. So the path a founder walks was: create a Replit database, set a
 *   passphrase, press Sign in, get a 500 carrying an incident id and the words
 *   "tell a mentor". The log line they never see said relation "founder" does
 *   not exist. It was the first wall on the path and every founder hit it.
 *   main() now calls ensureSchema() as soon as the database answers. Read
 *   boot/schema.ts for why that is a boot step rather than one more sentence on
 *   the start page: the one line command that fixes it needs a terminal, and a
 *   founder in that room does not have one, so a blocker there is a blocker
 *   nobody can act on.
 *
 *   THE CLI THE AGENT LOOP SPAWNS IS RESOLVED HERE TOO, for the same reason the
 *   ge checks are. The Agent SDK ships that binary as a per platform OPTIONAL
 *   dependency, so an install may skip it and still exit 0. Before this, such a
 *   copy booted green, answered /healthz with {"ok":true,"blockers":[]}, wrote
 *   no log line at all, and failed on the founder's first message. boot/
 *   platform-cli.ts resolves it and reads its ELF header, because resolving a
 *   path proves only that a file exists: the other half of this failure is the
 *   wrong C library build, which is present, correctly named, and fails at exec
 *   with an error naming a file that is plainly there. It reads rather than
 *   runs because ge/no-shell.test.ts holds the server to one spawn boundary.
 *
 *   IT BINDS 0.0.0.0. Binding localhost on a container means a health check
 *   that never passes and a deployment that looks like a hang.
 *
 *   SHUTDOWN DRAINS RATHER THAN DROPS. A turn is durable the moment it commits,
 *   so a container dying mid turn costs a founder the answer they were reading,
 *   not their work. Draining costs a few seconds and it is the difference
 *   between a founder retrying and a founder watching a sentence stop halfway.
 *   Open streams are told what is happening before the socket goes, so the
 *   browser reconnects with its Last-Event-ID and picks up where it left off.
 *
 *   NOTHING INTERNAL REACHES A BROWSER. installErrorHandler goes on before the
 *   first route, and the not found handler is registered whether or not the
 *   browser bundle was built. Between them, every answer this process can give
 *   is a sentence somebody wrote. Left to itself, Fastify answers a thrown
 *   error with that error's own message, and every sign in route reaches
 *   Postgres, whose driver writes its message as the failed query with the
 *   bound parameters printed after it. A database that does not answer turned
 *   POST /auth/request into a 500 carrying a founder's own email address.
 *
 *   THE SPA IS SERVED FROM dist/web AND SIGN IN IS NOT. Every sign in screen is
 *   rendered by the server, so a founder can sign in before the bundle exists
 *   and with JavaScript switched off. That is why this file starts and serves
 *   something useful even when `npm run build` has never been run.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. `npm start` and `npm run dev`. Nothing imports it.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. The environment through ./env.ts, and Postgres.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. A listening socket, the log, and whatever the routes write.
 */

// THE FIRST STATEMENT IN THIS MODULE, and it stays first.
//
// Said precisely, because the obvious reading of it is wrong: ESM hoists every
// import and evaluates those modules before any statement here runs. So what
// this actually depends on is that NOTHING IMPORTED BELOW DOES WORK AT MODULE
// SCOPE. db/client.ts opens its pool lazily, storage/crypto.ts reads the master
// key inside a function, storage/paths.ts reads the workspace root inside a
// function, and the agent modules are class definitions. A module added below
// that reads a secret or opens a socket while it loads would run before this
// line and would break the promise the whole file is built on.
//
// THE AGENT SDK IS NOW ONE OF THEM, through ./agent/sdk.ts, and it is the
// largest thing this file imports. That was checked rather than assumed:
// loading agent/sdk.ts, ge/run.ts, routes/run-turn.ts and
// routes/transcripts-pg.ts with an entirely empty environment completes and
// reads nothing. If a future SDK version starts reading a key at import time,
// this is the line the failure comes from, and the fix is a dynamic import
// inside buildServer() rather than moving loadEnv().
//
// integrations/contracts/index.ts JOINED THAT LIST, for the boot check in main().
// It builds the pending() Proxies while it loads, which is object construction and
// nothing else: no environment, no database, no node builtin. vendor-facts.test.ts
// holds that whole directory to importing nothing outside itself, because the same
// files are read by screens and reach the browser bundle. Checked rather than
// assumed: importing it behind a Proxy over process.env records no read of any
// variable of ours.
