/**
 * src/server/routes/contract.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The two halves of the app, checked against each other. Every
 * address `src/web/lib/api.ts` calls, walked against every route this server
 * registers, and it fails in both directions.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, and it is the most expensive lesson in this build.
 *
 * The browser and the server were written at the same time against the same
 * design document, by different people, and nothing compared them. Both halves
 * were green. 795 tests passed. `tsc` was clean on both projects. The golden
 * suite was 36 for 36. And a founder who pressed "Send me a link" read "There is
 * nothing at that address. Open your list and pick from there.", because
 * `POST /api/auth/request-link` had never been registered. FIFTEEN of the
 * browser's calls answered 404, including every one on the way in. A founder who
 * WAS on the roster was told their address was wrong.
 *
 * THAT ADDRESS NO LONGER EXISTS ON EITHER SIDE, and the way it went is this test
 * working. Signing in is a form post to `/auth/signin` now, so the browser
 * stopped calling `/api/auth/request-link` and the route behind it was deleted
 * in the same change. Had only one side moved, the run below would have named
 * it in one of the two directions.
 *
 * Not one of those 795 tests could have caught it, because every one of them
 * tested a half. The server tests drove routes that exist. The browser tests
 * stubbed fetch. The gap between them was the product, and nothing was looking
 * at it.
 *
 * SO THIS TEST LOOKS AT THE GAP, AND ONLY AT THE GAP.
 *
 *   Direction one: a path the browser calls with no route behind it. That is
 *   the failure above, and it is the one that shuts the front door.
 *
 *   Direction two: a route with nothing calling it. That is quieter and it is
 *   not cosmetic. Surface nobody calls is surface nobody exercises, and it is
 *   still surface somebody has to account for when the question is what a closed
 *   cohort's data is reachable through. Two routes were found this way the day
 *   this test was written, and both are gone.
 *
 * IT IS PROVED TO FAIL, HERE, PERMANENTLY. The last two tests in this file run
 * the comparison over a made up api.ts with a path nobody registered, and over a
 * made up route table with a route nobody calls, and assert that each is
 * reported. A test that has only ever been seen passing is a test nobody has
 * checked, and this one is load bearing enough that "it passed" is not evidence.
 *
 * AND IT ROUTES THE PATHS FOR REAL, because a name comparison is not the same
 * question as a router's answer. `/api/files/download.zip` and `/api/files/*`
 * are two routes whose paths overlap, and which one answers is a precedence rule
 * inside find-my-way rather than anything in this file. So every path is also
 * injected at the real app, with no cookie, and must come back refused rather
 * than not found.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. The real Fastify instance from ./test-fixtures.ts, and the
 * text of src/web/lib/api.ts.
 * WHAT IT READS. One source file. WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing.
