/**
 * src/server/routes/copy.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every sentence this folder puts in front of a founder, held to
 * the house style by the app's own prose rule.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `errors.test.ts` already does this for `ERRORS`, and the moment
 * a second and third table of refusals appeared, `SETUP_ERRORS` and
 * `FILE_ERRORS`, they were outside every check in the build. The rules gate runs
 * over what a model writes into a founder's folder. Nothing ran over what we
 * write on their screen.
 *
 * That gap is not cosmetic. A dash in a refusal is the same rule the toolkit
 * refuses a founder's own file for, and a founder who is told their content
 * cannot use one while the app uses one has been given two answers. It is also
 * the cheapest possible check: the rule already exists, it is the same one, and
 * running it here costs nothing.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE CHECKED THAT THE RULE CANNOT SEE, and both are the reason the
 * refusals in this folder exist at all. A sentence that says something is not
 * built has to say when the founder can do it instead, or "not yet" reads as
 * "never". And a sentence about work has to say the work is safe, because that
 * is the doubt the founder has first.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. The rules module's own prose check, and the two tables.
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing.
