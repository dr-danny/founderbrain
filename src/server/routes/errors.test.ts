/**
 * src/server/routes/errors.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every route this app registers, driven against a database that
 * throws, with one unique string planted inside the exception. The test passes
 * only if that string reaches no response body, no header and no page.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The hole it closes was real and it was open. There was no
 * `setErrorHandler` anywhere in the tree, so Fastify answered a thrown error
 * with that error's own message. Every sign in route reaches Postgres, and the
 * driver writes its message as the failed query with the bound parameters
 * printed after it. The sign in POST against a database that did not answer
 * replied 500 with what the founder had typed, the `founder` table name and its
 * column list, in a browser, in a room with 130 people in it.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS OF THAT ROUTE CHANGED AND THE HOLE DID NOT. It was
 * `POST /auth/request`, which took an email and looked it up on a roster. It is
 * `POST /auth/signin`, which takes a passphrase and reads the owner row. Same
 * store, same driver, same message, and now the thing that would come back is
 * the passphrase rather than an address, which is worse. So the two bug report
 * tests below drive the new address and the walk posts a passphrase field.
 *
 * ONE ROUTE AT A TIME WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT AND WILL NOT CATCH THE NEXT ONE.
 * A hand written list of routes to check is a list somebody forgets to add to.
 * So this reads the route table off the live Fastify instance through its own
 * `onRoute` hook and drives every entry in it. A route added next week is
 * covered the moment it is registered, and a route added while the handler is
 * missing fails here rather than on a founder's screen.
 *
 * THE SENTINEL IS THE WHOLE ASSERTION. Matching on the shape of a Postgres
 * error would only prove that today's driver is caught. A string that exists
 * nowhere else in the process proves that nothing at all crossed the line,
 * whatever threw it and whatever it was carrying.
 *
 * AND IT IS DRIVEN TWICE, THE SECOND TIME OVER A REAL SOCKET. `inject` builds a
 * request and a response in process and never opens one, so it cannot show a
 * response whose headers have already been flushed, or one the server never
 * finished. Both of those are states a founder meets. So every route is walked
 * again through the kernel, and two of the tests below read the socket by hand
 * because the thing they measure is whether the response was terminated at all,
 * which no client library will tell you.
 *
 * IT FAILS RATHER THAN HANGING, WHICH IT DID NOT ALWAYS DO. Every instance is
 * closed in a `finally`, so a failing assertion reports and the file exits. See
 * the comment above the first walk for what happened when the close sat after
 * the assertions instead.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. installErrorHandler, the real auth plugin and the real API
 * routes, against stores whose every method throws.
 * WHAT IT READS. src/server/index.ts, as text, to prove the handler is wired
 * before the first route.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing durable. It binds loopback ports the kernel picks,
 * and closes them.

 * loop open. The file then printed all of its results and never exited. Measured,
 * not reasoned about: with one assertion in the socket walk forced to fail,
 * `node --import tsx --test src/server/routes/errors.test.ts` printed 15 results
 * and was still running two minutes later.
 *
 * `npm test` passes `--test-timeout=30000`, so CI turns that into a cancelled file

 * running this one file on its own is exactly what you do when you are chasing the
 * failure it just reported.
 *
 * A HANG IS THE WORST WAY FOR A TEST TO FAIL. A red assertion names the route, the
 * header and the string. A hang names nothing, and the first guess is always that
 * the test is slow rather than that it is finished and stuck.
 *
 * WHY `finally` AND NOT A HOOK. `t.after(() => app.close())` is the tidier looking
 * answer and it was tried first. In this file it does not work: the close starts
 * and never completes, and the file hangs on a green run. That is a fact from
 * running it, and the cause is not understood, so the construct with no moving
 * parts is the one that ships six days before a freeze. `finally` puts the close
