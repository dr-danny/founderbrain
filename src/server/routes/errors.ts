/**
 * src/server/routes/errors.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every sentence a founder reads when a request does not work,
 * the one shape they are all sent in, and the handler that catches everything
 * nobody wrote a sentence for.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Three failures.
 *
 *   A status code is not a sentence. A browser handed a bare 404 has to invent
 *   wording for it, and the wording it invents will be wrong on the day it
 *   matters. Every refusal here carries the sentence with it, so the interface
 *   renders text somebody wrote on purpose.
 *
 *   And a founder who has just lost a message needs to know their work is safe
 *   before anything else. That is the doubt to name first. Several of these say
 *   it in as many words, because it is true and because it is the question
 *   being asked.
 *
 *   AND AN EXCEPTION IS NOT A SENTENCE EITHER. It is worse than a status code,
 *   because it is somebody else's writing about our insides. With no handler
 *   installed, Fastify answers a thrown error with that error's own message.
 *   The sign in route reaches Postgres, and the Postgres driver writes its
 *   message as the failed query with the bound parameters printed after it. So
 *   `POST /auth/signin` against a database that does not answer replied 500
 *   with what the founder had just typed, the table name and the column list in
 *   the body. That is a screenshot, in a room, on the day. On this build the
 *   bound parameter would be OWNER_PASSPHRASE, which is the only secret the
 *   whole deployment has.
 *
 *   `installErrorHandler` is the wall. Nothing internal crosses it: no query
 *   text, no bound parameter, no stack, no file path, no table name, no library
 *   error code, no exception message of any kind. The founder gets a plain
 *   sentence and somewhere to go. The detail goes to the log with an incident
 *   id, and the founder is handed the same id to quote.
 *
 *   IT FAILS CLOSED. Anything it does not recognise becomes the 500 sentence
 *   with an incident id, whatever status the thrown thing was carrying. A
 *   refusal we forgot to map then shows up in the log as a question to answer,
 *   rather than as confident wrong advice on a founder's screen.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. Every route file in this folder, for ERRORS and errorBody.
 * src/server/index.ts calls installErrorHandler once inside buildServer, before
 * any route is registered.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. Nothing. WHAT IT WRITES. One log line per caught failure,
 * through the Logger it is handed, and one response.

 * The founder facing explanation for a `HarvestRefused`, or null when there

 * WHY ONLY TWO CODES GET A SENTENCE HERE, AND IT IS A CHOICE, NOT AN
 * OVERSIGHT. `folder_too_large` and `too_many_files` are the founder running
 * into a limit they can see and move, on the Setup screen. Their folder is
 * exactly what they left it: nothing is lost, and "delete something or raise
 * the limit" is true, specific advice.
 *
 * Every other code means the folder is in a shape the app did not expect,
 * which the founder did not choose and cannot fix themselves:
 *   `symlink`, `not_a_file`   something on disk that no code path here writes.
 *   `unexplained_absence`     a row in the database with nothing to match it.
 *   `bad_path`                a name the storage layer will not accept.
 *   `file_too_large`          one file over the per file limit, not the whole
 *                             folder; today's callers have no branch for it
 *                             either, and adding one is a separate change.
 * Those stay a fault worth an incident id, so this returns null for them and
 * the caller falls back to its own generic message.
 *
 * THE SWITCH HAS NO WILDCARD DEFAULT. `HarvestRefused['code']` is a closed
 * union, every member is listed below by name, and the `never` assignment in
 * the `default` branch is what makes the compiler refuse to build the day a
 * new code is added to that union and not to this switch — the alternative,
 * a `default: return null`, would let a brand new refusal silently read as
 * "nothing to explain" instead of failing loudly at typecheck time.
