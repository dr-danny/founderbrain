/**
 * src/server/routes/files.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Rule 4 as five HTTP routes: list what a founder has, open one
 * file, download one file, download the whole folder as a ZIP, and the one that
 * honestly refuses to save a pasted sample yet.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. On a laptop this rule held itself. The files were in a folder
 * the founder could open, and if they could not find it that was their problem
 * and their fix. On a server it is our problem, and the ways to break it are
 * quiet ones.
 *
 *   SERVED FROM THE RECORD, NOT FROM THE SCRATCH FOLDER. `/tmp/ge/<id>/` is a
 *   cache and is not durable. A download that read it would hand a founder an
 *   empty folder after a container restart, or worse, half of one. Every byte
 *   here comes from `ge_blob`, decrypted with that founder's own data key.
 *
 *   NOTHING USER SUPPLIED IS EVER USED AS A PATH. The requested name is checked
 *   against the safe path rule and then against this founder's own `ge_file`
 *   rows. A name that is not in their own list does not resolve, whatever it
 *   looks like. That is what makes `../../etc/passwd` and somebody else's slug
 *   the same non answer.
 *
 *   THE ZIP HOLDS REAL PEOPLE. A founder's `people/` folder is 25 to 35 real
 *   names, companies, titles and email addresses, none of whom agreed to be in
 *   our database. Session authenticated, own id only, never an id from a query
 *   parameter. There is no route in this file that takes a founder id.
 *
 *   RULE 1 IS CHECKED HERE TOO, on every route. `ge index` forks on the Track
 *   line, so a founder's folder does not normally hold the other track's files
 *   at all, and the browser drops such a row if one arrives. That leaves this
 *   as the middle of the three, and it is the only one of them that a typed
 *   address cannot walk past. A file belonging to the other track is absent
 *   from the list, absent from the ZIP, and answers as a missing file when it
 *   is asked for by name.
 *
 *   THE LIST CARRIES FILES THAT DO NOT EXIST YET, on purpose. A founder in week
 *   one has almost nothing, and a list of what they have is a blank screen. A
 *   list of what they will have, with "Not made yet" against most of it, is the
 *   programme. So the rows are the gate table for their track, each carrying
 *   its real state, plus anything else of theirs the table does not name.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. ./index.ts registers it. The files screen and every download
 * button call it.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. `ge_file` and `ge_blob`, founder scoped, through the AppStore.
 * `schemas/gates.md`, through the rules gate, for which track sees which file
 * and which gate each one counts towards.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing.

   * One file, read on screen.

   * The wildcard is the path inside `growth-engine/`. It is checked three
   * times: against the safe path rule, which refuses absolute paths, `..` and
   * control characters; against this founder's track; and against this
   * founder's own rows, which is the check that decides whether it exists.
   *
   * The track check comes before the read, so the other track's file is never
   * decrypted, and it answers as a missing file rather than as a refusal. That
   * is the same shape rule 1 takes everywhere else: the other track's material
   * is absent, not greyed out with a note saying what it is.
