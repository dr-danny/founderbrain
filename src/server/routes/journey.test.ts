/**
 * src/server/routes/journey.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A founder signing in and reaching their Founder Brain, driven
 * through the browser's own code, against the real server. The functions in
 * `src/web/lib/api.ts` are called here exactly as a screen calls them, and their
 * fetch goes into this app's router instead of onto a network.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `contract.test.ts` next door proves every address the browser
 * calls has a route behind it. That is the first half of the gap and it is not
 * the whole of it. The other half is shape.
 *
 * `/api/me` was registered the whole time. It answered 200. It was reached on
 * every page load. And the browser read `signedIn` off a body that carries no
 * such field, so a founder with a live session in their browser was shown the
 * sign in screen for ever, and no test on either side could see it: the server
 * test asserted the body it sends, the browser test stubbed a body it expects,
 * and the two bodies were different.
 *
 * The only thing that catches that is running one against the other. So this
 * file holds no assertion about a body at all. It calls the browser's own
 * functions and asserts on what they hand back, which is the thing a screen
 * actually renders. If the two halves disagree about a field name, a Result
 * comes back at `ok: false` or a field comes back undefined, and the test says
 * so in the words of the journey rather than in the words of a payload.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVED HERE, in order, because it is the order a founder does it:
 * find the door shut, type the passphrase, be recognised, answer the two first
 * run questions, see where they are up to, open the Founder Brain, send a
 * message, read their files and their gates, and sign out.
 *
 * THE FRONT DOOR CHANGED AND THIS FILE CHANGED WITH IT. The journey used to
 * start by asking for an emailed link. There is no roster and no mail sender
 * now: one founder owns the deployment and signs in with OWNER_PASSPHRASE, a
 * Replit Secret. That is a plain HTML form the browser posts itself, so it is
 * driven here as a form post rather than through api.ts, which is exactly how a
 * founder with JavaScript switched off gets in. Everything after the door is
 * still driven through the browser's own functions.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. `src/web/lib/api.ts`, and the real Fastify instance from
 * ./test-fixtures.ts.
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing outside the process. `fetch` is replaced for
 * the length of a test and put back afterwards.
