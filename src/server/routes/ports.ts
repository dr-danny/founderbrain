/**
 * src/server/routes/ports.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Everything the HTTP layer needs from the database and from the
 * agent, expressed as interfaces. No behaviour.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Two failures.
 *
 *   The first is untested routes. There is no Postgres on a laptop here and
 *   there will not be one in CI before the freeze, so a route layer that
 *   imports Drizzle directly is a route layer nobody runs until the deployment.
 *   The four properties this build has to prove, one founder never seeing
 *   another's workspace among them, are properties of these routes and they
 *   have to be provable on a laptop.
 *
 *   The second is quieter and worse. EVERY METHOD HERE THAT TOUCHES FOUNDER
 *   DATA TAKES A FOUNDER ID AS ITS FIRST ARGUMENT, and that argument comes from
 *   the session cookie and from nowhere else. Writing the store as an interface
 *   makes that shape visible on one screen: there is no method that reads a
 *   thread by id alone, so there is no way to write a handler that reads
 *   somebody else's thread by accident. `WHERE founder_id` is the first belt and
 *   row level security in Postgres is the second.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. Every file in src/server/routes/. Wired to Drizzle by
 * ./store-pg.ts and to Maps by ./test-fixtures.ts.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing. Types only.
