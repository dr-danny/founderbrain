/**
 * src/server/routes/setup.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The setup rail: what is set up, the two first run answers, the
 * state of each step of the GoHighLevel walk, the Location ID, and
 * disconnecting. Plus the two routes that honestly refuse, because the thing
 * they would do has never been proved to work.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Setup has two finish lines and the app names both. Ready to
 * start is sign in, a name and a timezone, due before session 1, and it blocks
 * everything. Ready to publish is GoHighLevel and an account to post to, due by
 * the clinic on 23 September (GoHighLevel itself is bought and connected in Session 2,
 * on 14 or 15 September), and it blocks publishing and sending only. A
 * founder who has done tier one is done for now, and the screen can only say
 * that if this route tells it which rows are in which tier's state.
 *
 * THE TIMEZONE IS THE ONE ANSWER NOTHING ELSE CAN CAPTURE. A laptop knew it and
 * a server does not. It is stored as an IANA name and never an offset, because
 * offsets change twice a year and a 90 day plan built on 27 September runs past
 * the 1 November change. So the write below refuses a zone this Node cannot
 * resolve rather than storing it: a bad zone is silent, and every date after it
 * is wrong by however many hours.
 *
 * TWO ROUTES REFUSE, AND THAT IS THE HONEST ANSWER TODAY.
 *
 *   `POST /api/setup/ghl/token` and `POST /api/setup/ghl/verify` are the screen
 *   that makes the difference: the founder does not get a green tick, they get
 *   evidence, from three reads against GoHighLevel. THE SPIKE HAS NEVER RUN.
 *   Every endpoint, header, field name and status code for those reads is
 *   unverified, which is why `src/server/integrations/contracts/` holds holes
 *   that throw rather than plausible values.
 *
 *   So there are two ways to write these routes. One stores the token and
 *   answers `{ ok: true }`, which is a green tick we invented, on a credential
 *   we cannot use, three weeks before anybody finds out. The other says what is
 *   true: we cannot check it yet, so do not paste it yet. This is the second
 *   one. Nothing unverifiable is put in the database, and the founder is given
 *   the next thing to do rather than a tick.
 *
 *   They answer 501, which is the server saying it does not do this, rather
 *   than 404, which would say there is nothing at that address. The address
 *   exists. What it does is not built.
 *
 * AND ONE ROUTE DOES NOT REFUSE, WHICH IS THE ANTHROPIC KEY.
 *
 *   `POST /api/setup/key` is the first thing a founder does after signing in, and until
 *   today there was nowhere to do it. `boot/readiness.ts` told them to paste their key
 *   into the setup screen; there was no route, no form and no field anywhere that took
 *   one. The key was read once out of the environment at startup, so even a founder who
 *   found Replit Secrets would have needed a restart nobody told them about and that they
 *   cannot perform.
 *
 *   IT IS NOT LIKE THE GOHIGHLEVEL ROUTES ABOVE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS EVIDENCE. The
 *   GoHighLevel check refuses because nobody has ever made those calls and every field
 *   name in them is a guess. Anthropic's is not a guess: this app already talks to that
 *   API on every turn, the addresses and header names are in the Claude API reference, and
 *   the check below is two real calls whose answer is the founder's answer. So this one
 *   verifies for real, and it does it before the key is stored rather than three screens
 *   later.
 *
 *   THE ORDER IS CHECK, THEN STORE, THEN ANNOUNCE. A key that has not been proved is never
 *   written down, so `set: true` on the screen means Anthropic accepted it and not that
 *   somebody typed something. Storing it puts it in memory, and the holder tells
 *   `boot/readiness.ts`, which drops its blocker and reopens the two routes that start a
 *   turn. That is what makes it work without a restart.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. ./index.ts registers it. The setup screens and the token walk.
 * WHAT IT READS. `founder`, `setup_steps` and `connections`, founder scoped.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. `founder` (name and timezone), `setup_steps`, `connections`.
