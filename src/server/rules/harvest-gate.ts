/**
 * src/server/rules/harvest-gate.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The rules gate in the one place it has to stand: between the model writing a
 *   file into the founder's folder and storage committing that file to `ge_file`.
 *   One call, over everything a turn produced, with an answer for each file and
 *   one answer for the turn.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   `index.ts` has always claimed this seat. Its header says the gate sits between
 *   the model writing a file and storage saving it, and that nothing reaches
 *   `ge_file` until it has answered. That claim was false: `runRules` had no caller
 *   outside its own folder, so rules 1 to 5 were enforced in prose, in the skills
 *   and in unit tests, and nowhere a founder could reach. A gate with no caller is
 *   a comment with a test suite. This file is the caller, and it makes the sentence
 *   in `index.ts` true.
 *
 *   IT FAILS CLOSED ON THE FILE. A file that fails a rule is not written to
 *   `ge_file`, ever, and no flag anywhere lets a caller save it anyway. The
 *   alternative, storing the file and attaching a warning, is the thing the build
 *   document rules out in one line: a write that cannot be proved must not be
 *   reported as done. A file with a banned word in it that is saved anyway is a
 *   file a founder will send to somebody.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. READ THIS BEFORE MOVING ANYTHING.
 *
 * This file used to have two: the turn passed, or `RulesRefused` was thrown and
 * `storage/turn.ts` rolled the whole turn back and removed the folder. One
 * sentence in one file cost every file that turn wrote. On the Sunday turn that is
 * a growth plan, an outreach sequence and a prospect CSV, gone, and the founder
 * told they invented proof.
 *
 * THE COUNTER ARGUMENT IS REAL AND IT USED TO BE WRITTEN HERE, so it is answered
 * rather than deleted. It ran: a turn writes several files and they are saved in
 * one transaction, so letting four through and refusing the fifth leaves a folder
 * that half describes a business, which is harder to explain to a founder than a
 * clean refusal they can act on.
 *
 * Two things are wrong with it.
 *
 *   The refusal is only clean if the founder is told nothing. A folder missing one
 *   named file, with a sentence saying which file, which line and what to do, is
 *   not a folder that half describes a business by accident. It is a folder minus
 *   one file, on purpose, and the founder knows which one.
 *
 *   It assumes the rule is right. These rules are vocabulary lists. `track.ts`
 *   speaks on the word "ICP" and on "cold email". `prose.ts` speaks on a list of
 *   words lifted from a shell script. `no-invented-proof.ts` speaks on a number it
 *   could not tie to the Brain. Every one of those can be wrong about an ordinary
 *   sentence, and one reviewer found fourteen ways past the DM list in a sitting.
 *   So the trade is not "confusing folder against clean refusal". It is "confusing
 *   folder against a founder losing an hour on the Monday of a three day event
 *   because a list did not have a word in it".
 *
 *   THAT ARGUMENT WAS TAKEN FURTHER SINCE, AND `confidence.ts` IS WHERE IT WENT.
 *   Holding a file instead of a turn made a wrong rule survivable. It did not make
 *   it quiet. Measured against twenty sentences an ordinary founder would type,
 *   fourteen still lost the founder a file. So every finding this folder can make
 *   was asked, one at a time, whether it is confident and whether the harm is real,
 *   and only the ones that answer yes to both can hold anything now. The count is
 *   one of twenty. Read that file before deciding a rule here is too quiet: the
 *   volume decision lives there, and this file only decides what a hold costs.
 *
 * SO A BLOCKING VIOLATION NOW HAS TWO SHAPES, and `outcomeFor` below is the whole
 * decision:
 *
 *   REFUSE THE TURN   `RulesRefused` is thrown, storage rolls back, the folder is
 *                     removed, nothing is saved. Reserved for the short list in
 *                     `WORTH_THE_WHOLE_TURN`.
 *   HOLD THE FILE     that one file is not written to `ge_file`. Every other file
 *                     the turn wrote is committed. The founder is told which file,
 *                     which line, and what to do. This is the default, including
 *                     for a code this file has never heard of.
 *
 * WHERE THE LINE SITS, because the next person will move it. A violation is worth
 * the whole turn only when BOTH of these hold:
 *
 *   1  The rule has been MEASURED against ordinary founder writing and does not
 *      fire on it. Not argued to be precise: run, over sentences a founder would
 *      really write, with the count written down. Two independent signals having
 *      to agree is what makes that possible, and it is still not the evidence.
 *   2  It is evidence about the RUN, not about the file. A model that offered to
 *      automate cold DMs was in a state where it was willing to do that. Every
 *      other file in the same turn came out of that same state, and this gate only
 *      catches the phrasings it happens to have words for. Refusing the turn is
 *      refusing to trust the rest of a run that has already been caught once.
 *
 * An em dash fails test 2, and it now fails an earlier one as well: it does not
 * hold a file at all, because a punctuation preference the founder never agreed to
 * is not harm. A number the rule could not classify fails test 1. The other
 * track's vocabulary fails test 2 and passes test 1, so it holds its file, which is
 * the whole of rule 1's job here: a file that is never stored is a file the founder
 * is never shown.
 *
 * TEST 1 IS WRITTEN THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT ALREADY CAUGHT SOMETHING. Rule 5's
 * strong reading, an ungrounded number stated as a fact about the business, was on
 * the list on the argument alone. Measured, it fired on seven of fourteen ordinary
 * sentences, five of them observations of the kind CLAUDE.md tells a founder to
 * write when proof is thin. The note under the table has the numbers. An argument
 * for precision is not precision.
 *
 * THAT SAME MEASUREMENT HAS SINCE BEEN RUN OVER TWENTY SENTENCES AND OVER EVERY
 * RULE, not just rule 5, and it is kept runnable in `confidence.test.ts`. Rule 5
 * was split in two by it: the shapes that fired on ordinary writing became notes,
 * and the three that did not stayed able to hold a file. The entry below is
 * unaffected, because rule 2 was already measured and already passed.
 *
 * MONEY, SENDING AND CREDENTIALS ARE STILL FAIL CLOSED, and holding is what makes
 * them so rather than what threatens them. Nothing downstream reads the folder: a
 * publish batch is built from `ge_file`, and `db/schema.ts` says in one line that
 * there is no sequence of model outputs that posts, enrolls, sends or spends. A
 * held file is never written to `ge_file`, so it can reach no vendor, no payload
 * and no preview. The turn level rollback was never the thing protecting them.
 *
 * ADDING A SECOND ENTRY TO `WORTH_THE_WHOLE_TURN` costs a founder a turn's work
 * every time the rule behind it is wrong. Run the measurement, put the count in the
 * table beside the argument, or leave it out and let the file be held. The test
 * named "ordinary founder sentences never cost a turn" is where the measurement
 * lives and it will fail for you if the answer is no.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT LOOK AT, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A HOLE
 *   The gate reads what the MODEL wrote. `schemas/writers.md` splits the folder in
 *   two: the engines write the founder's content files, and `ge` writes `ledger.md`,
 *   `memory.md`, `ops-log.md`, `people/`, `snapshots/` and everything under
 *   `.state/`. Those are excluded here, by name, in a list a test pins.
 *
 *   The reason is a real failure and not tidiness. The rules in this folder hold a
 *   second implementation of `ge`'s own file formats: the person kind lines, the
 *   marker pairs, the ledger columns. Running that second parser over `ge`'s output
 *   mid turn means the day the two disagree, a founder loses a file they never
 *   wrote and cannot fix. `ge` refuses rather than guesses at its own writes, and
 *   the app does not second guess it.
 *
 *   `voice-samples/` is excluded for rule 6 and rule 4 together. Those are the
 *   founder's own words, put there so the model can read them. Holding a founder's
 *   own writing to the house style is the app correcting a person's prose without
 *   being asked.
 *
 *   `dm-openers.md` IS gated, even though `ge person export openers` owns the
 *   `GE:TARGETS` block inside it, because the audience engine owns the rest of it
 *   and the rest of it is what a founder sends to a stranger.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 *   `storage/turn.ts`, once per turn, after `planHarvest` and before
 *   `applyHarvest`. Nothing else should: a gate called after the write is a report.
 *   The caller has a job on the way out as well: every path in `report.held` has to
 *   come out of the plan before `applyHarvest` sees it. `storage/turn.ts` does that
 *   in one function and the test beside it proves the held file never reaches
 *   `ge_file`.
 *
 * READS   the bytes the harvest plan already read from the folder, and, through the
 *         `readPrevious` callback it is handed, the stored version of a changed
 *         file. It opens no file and no database connection itself, which is what
 *         keeps the whole policy testable without Postgres.
 * WRITES  nothing. It answers, or it throws.

/*
 * WHY `proof.invented-result` IS NOT ON THAT LIST, and the next person will try to
 * put it back, so here is the measurement that says not to.
 *
 * READ THE NUMBERS BELOW AS HISTORY. They were taken when one code covered every
 * reading rule 5 could make. That code has since been split: the wide shapes are
 * `proof.unbacked-figure` and they are notes, and `proof.invented-result` is now
 * only the three shapes that did not fire on ordinary writing. The conclusion is
 * unchanged and the reasoning is why, so it is kept rather than rewritten.
 *
 * It is the obvious candidate. It reads as the strong half of rule 5: the number is
 * in nothing the founder ever said, AND the sentence states it as a fact about
 * their business. An invented customer count is the thing rule 5 exists for, and
 * refusing a run that produced one is a defensible instinct.
 *
 * Then it was run. Fourteen sentences an ordinary founder could write, against a
 * clean Brain and no other grounding. Seven came back as `proof.invented-result`:
 *
 *     We have 214 customers on the platform today.        a real invention
 *     Last week I spoke to 6 operations leads.            an observation
 *     I read 12 job posts this morning.                   an observation
 *     There are 25 people on my list.                     the toolkit's own number
 *     I have written 30 posts this quarter.               the toolkit's own number
 *     The average reply rate people quote is 3 percent.   not about their business
 *     We saved a client 11 hours a week.                  a real invention
 *
 * Two of the seven are the thing the rule is for. The rest are ordinary writing,
 * and three of them are what CLAUDE.md tells a founder to do when proof is thin:
 * write from point of view and observation. The classifier reads "result" for most
 * sentences with a number in them. That fails the first test above, so it holds its
 * file like everything else.
 *
 * NOTHING IS LOST BY HOLDING IT. The invented count still never reaches `ge_file`,
 * the founder is still told which line and why, and rule 5's actual harm, a founder
 * sending a stranger a figure they cannot stand behind, is prevented by the file not
 * existing. What holding gives back is the growth plan written beside it.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD PUT IT BACK. A `proof.invented-result` that fires on the two inventions
 * above and on neither of the five observations. The test named "ordinary founder
 * sentences never cost a turn" in harvest-gate.test.ts is the measurement, kept
 * runnable, so the day the rule gets sharper the evidence for changing this is one
 * command away.

 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN IT. No rule code, no rule number, no pattern, and no
