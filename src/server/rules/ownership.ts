/**
 * ownership.ts: rule 4. Everything the founder makes is theirs, visible and
 *   downloadable.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: on a laptop this rule held itself. The files were in a folder
 *   the founder could open, and if they could not find the folder that was
 *   their problem and their fix. On a server it is our problem, and the ways to
 *   break it are quiet ones. A file written outside `growth-engine/` never
 *   reaches the files view or the download. A file written to a name nothing
 *   lists is on disk and invisible, which is worse than absent because the
 *   founder is told it exists. And a rewrite that tidies up the founder's own
 *   sentences takes something that was theirs and makes it ours.
 *
 *   That last one is the ported version of `tests/cases/26-founder-prose.sh`
 *   from the content repo, which exists because `memory.md` says "Anything
 *   below this heading is yours, ge never writes here" and ordinary commands
 *   were breaking that promise. On a laptop a shell test could catch it. Here
 *   it has to be checked on the way past, because the writer is a model.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 *   1. Containment. The path sits inside `growth-engine/`, is relative, has no
 *      `..` in it, and is not absolute.
 *   2. Visibility. The path is one the files view and the ZIP will list: a file
 *      gates.md names, a `.state/` file, or a person file whose name follows the
 *      derive rule in `schemas/person.md`.
 *   3. The founder's own blocks. Everything outside ge's markers, and
 *      everything under `## Yours`, is byte for byte what it was.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, and why: the size and count limits. Those are
 *   storage's, they are refused before the write, and a second copy of a limit
 *   is a second number to keep in step.
 *
 * CALLED BY: index.ts, before an artifact is saved.
 * READS:     `schemas/gates.md` through gates-source.ts, and the twelve schema
 *            files, for the line in each that says where its file lives.
 * WRITES:    nothing.
