/**
 * src/server/storage/harvest.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The rule that decides whether a founder keeps a file or loses it,
 * under test, with no database and no ge spawn.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. diffFiles holds one branch that must never be got wrong: a ge_file
 * row with no file on disk means ge deleted it if the path was materialised, and means
 * data loss in progress if it was not. Those need opposite responses and they look
 * identical. If that branch were only reachable through a live Postgres and a real
 * spawn, it would get tested once and never again.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. src/server/storage/harvest.ts and paths.ts. Nothing else.
