/**
 * src/server/storage/harvest.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   Walking the founder's folder after the work of a turn, hashing every file, and
 *   writing back into Postgres what actually changed.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   THE RULE, stated as a rule: anything written to the container filesystem that
 *   has not been harvested into Postgres is already lost. This file is the only
 *   thing standing between a founder finishing a turn and that sentence being about
 *   them.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 *   storage/turn.ts, at step 12, inside the same transaction that took the advisory
 *   lock. Nothing else, ever: a harvest outside the lock is two writers.
 *
 * READS  <founderRoot>/growth-engine/**, ge_file
 * WRITES ge_blob, ge_file, ge_file_version
 *
 * WHY HASH INSTEAD OF TRACKING WRITES. One verb can touch four files. ge person
 * touch writes the person file and a snapshot. ge ledger approve writes ledger.md
 * and .state/approved-at. Guessing which files moved is a bug generator. Walking
 * about 60 small files and hashing them takes under a millisecond and cannot be
 * wrong.
 *
 * WHY AN UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE REFUSES THE TURN. A ge_file row with no file on disk
 * has two possible causes. If the path WAS in the materialised set, ge deleted the
 * file, which is normal. If it was NOT, materialise never wrote it, which is data
 * loss in progress. The two need opposite responses and they look identical, so the
 * materialised set is what tells them apart. Comparing against it turns a
 * materialise bug into a refused turn and a page saying try again, instead of a
 * silent DELETE of a founder's work.
 *
 * A SYMLINK REFUSES TOO. The model has Read, Write, Edit, Glob and Grep and no
 * Bash, so it cannot make one. ge does not make one. A symlink in the folder is
 * therefore an anomaly, and following it would let the harvest store bytes from
 * outside the founder's tree under a path inside it.
