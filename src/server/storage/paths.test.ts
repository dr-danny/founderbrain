/**

 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The tenancy boundary under test.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. paths.ts is the only thing between a string that arrived from a model
 * Write, a download URL or a founder's own typing and a file on disk. Every case below
 * is a way somebody has escaped a directory somewhere. The assertions are negative on
 * purpose: the strongest thing to prove about this file is what it refuses.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. src/server/storage/paths.ts only. No database, no filesystem.
