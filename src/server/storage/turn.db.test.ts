/**
 * src/server/storage/turn.db.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The turn, end to end, against a real Postgres. Materialise, work,
 * harvest, commit, and the refusal that rolls all of it back.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. fail-closed.test.ts proves the decision and proves the folder is
 * removed, using a database handle that refuses to write. Neither of those proves
 * the thing that matters most on the day: that a refused turn leaves the RECORD
 * exactly as it was. Only a real ROLLBACK proves that, and "we rolled back" is the
 * sentence a founder is told when their data is untouched.
 *
 * IT SKIPS WITHOUT A DATABASE, LOUDLY, AND ONE ASSERTION AT A TIME. There is no
 * Postgres on the machine this was written on, so every assertion below is written
 * to run when one appears and to say so plainly when one does not. The skip is on
 * each `it` rather than on the `describe`, because node:test counts a skipped test
 * and does not count a skipped suite: skipping the suite whole printed `ok` beside
 * it and left `# skipped 0` in the summary, which said nothing had been left out
 * while six assertions had. tests/db/setup.ts owns the reason.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN IT
 *   createdb launchhouse_test 2>/dev/null
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/launchhouse_test \
 *   GE_MASTER_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))") \
 *   npx tsx --test src/server/storage/turn.db.test.ts
 *
 * IT TAKES THE DATABASE FROM tests/db/setup.ts RATHER THAN MIGRATING IT ITSELF. This
 * file and turn.concurrency.test.ts both used to call runMigrations() in their own
 * before hook, node:test runs test files in parallel, and `create extension if not
 * exists citext` is not safe to run twice at once. Each suite alone was green and the
 * pair was red, so these six assertions had never run green in a whole `npm test`.
 * The claim is a lock: one database suite at a time. See that file for why the fix is
 * a lock and not a database each.
 *
 * IT MIGRATES THE DATABASE IT IS POINTED AT, and it deletes the founder rows it
 * creates afterwards. Point it at a scratch database, never at anything holding a
 * real founder.
 *
 * WHAT IT CALLS. storage/turn.ts, storage/harvest.ts, storage/materialise.ts,
 * tests/db/setup.ts, db/client.ts, and the filesystem.
