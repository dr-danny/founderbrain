/**
 * src/server/storage/turn.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The turn. Take the per founder gate, open on the record, rebuild the folder from
 *   Postgres if the epoch is stale, run the thing with no connection held, plan the
 *   harvest, put what the model wrote through the rules gate, commit. Every state
 *   change in the app goes through this function.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   THE RULE: anything written to the container filesystem that has not been
 *   harvested into Postgres is already lost. Everything in this file is one of two
 *   things: making that not happen, or refusing rather than pretending it did not.
 *
 *   The second half matters as much as the first. A write that cannot be proved must
 *   not be reported as done. An unexplained absence rolls the turn back and tells the
 *   founder to try again, with their data untouched, rather than deleting a row and
 *   showing a green tick.
 *
 * THE RULES GATE RUNS HERE, BETWEEN THE PLAN AND THE WRITE. rules/index.ts has
 * always said the gate sits between the model writing a file and storage saving it.
 * This is the seat it was talking about, and the order below is what makes the
 * sentence true: planHarvest reads the bytes, gateHarvest answers on them, and only
 * then does applyHarvest touch ge_file. Nothing here can be reordered without the
 * test beside this file failing.
 *
 * A FAILED FILE COSTS THE FILE. IT USED TO COST THE TURN. The gate now answers per
 * file, and this file is what makes that answer real:
 *
 *   report.held        those paths come out of the plan before applyHarvest sees
 *                      it, so they never reach ge_file, and everything else the
 *                      turn wrote commits. See withoutHeldFiles below.
 *   RulesRefused       still thrown, still rolls the whole transaction back, still
 *                      removes the folder. Reserved for the one violation that says
 *                      the RUN went wrong rather than one file, an offer to
 *                      automate cold DMs. The list, the argument, and the
 *                      measurement that keeps it one line long, are in
 *                      rules/harvest-gate.ts.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT IS WORTH THE COMPLICATION. The rules are vocabulary lists. When one
 * is wrong about an ordinary sentence, the old behaviour deleted a growth plan, an
 * outreach sequence and a prospect CSV, and told the founder they invented proof. A
 * heuristic must not be able to destroy work a founder cannot get back, and a held
 * file is still never stored, so nothing is saved that could not be proved.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 *   The agent runner around a model run, ge/verbs.ts around a single ge spawn, and
 *   the setup and gate routes. The work function receives a context and does its own
 *   thing inside the folder; this file owns everything around it.
 *
 * READS  founder, ge_file, ge_blob, and the folder on disk
 * WRITES ge_file, ge_file_version, ge_blob, ge_event, founder.version, founder.track
 *
 * WRITE THROUGH, NOT WRITE BEHIND. Founders type at human speed and the corpus is
 * small. A turn is durable the moment it returns, so there is no window where a
 * container death costs a founder the last thing they said.
 *
 * ONE WRITER PER FOUNDER COMES FROM HERE, NOT FROM ge. ge does not enforce one
 * writer at runtime; that is a design rule in schemas/writers.md checked by hand.
 * What ge enforces is snapshot before overwrite, build whole and move into place,
 * and refuse rather than guess. Concurrency is solved by the three locks below,
 * and ge never sees two writers because the app never gives it any.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TURN IS TWO TRANSACTIONS WITH THE MODEL RUN BETWEEN THEM, AND IT USED TO BE
 * ONE. This is the most important change in this file, so here is the whole story.
 *
 * The build document, section 2 steps 6 to 15, describes the turn as BEGIN, lock,
 * materialise, run, harvest, COMMIT. That reads well and it is wrong in one word:
 * "run". A ge spawn is seconds. A MODEL run is 30 to 180 seconds by the build
 * document's own figure, and longer when a founder is mid Founder Brain. Holding a
 * transaction across it means holding a pooled connection across it, and the pool
 * is PGPOOL_MAX connections wide, default 10.
 *
 * That was not a slow app. It was a permanently wedged one, and it was measured
 * against a real Postgres before this was written:
 *
 *     2 turns    2 of 2 finished
 *     9 turns    9 of 9 finished
 *    10 turns    0 of 10 finished in 25 seconds
 *    24 turns    0 of 24 finished in 25 seconds
 *    1 turn with PGPOOL_MAX=1    never finished
 *
 * The mechanism: inside the run, AgentRun.spawn asks Budget for the spend cap,
 * Budget asks the spend ledger, and the ledger queries THE POOL. So one turn needed
 * two connections. Ten turns each held one and each waited for the eleventh, which
 * only frees when a turn ends, which cannot happen. MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS ships at 24,
 * so the app deadlocked well below its own configured concurrency. On the Monday
 * night, 65 founders on one track all working at once, that is the event.
 *
 * Raising PGPOOL_MAX moves the number and keeps the shape. The shape is the bug: a
 * scarce fixed resource held for a duration decided by something outside the app.
 * So the transaction no longer spans the run.
 *
 *   T1, milliseconds.  BEGIN, scope, advisory lock, read the founder, materialise,
 *                      invalidate the epoch, COMMIT.
 *   the run.           NO transaction, NO connection held. Minutes are fine here.
 *   T2, milliseconds.  BEGIN, scope, advisory lock, prove nothing moved, plan,
 *                      the rules gate, apply, bump, ge_event, COMMIT.
 *
 * T1 WRITES NOTHING TO THE RECORD. It is a read and a lock; materialise writes only
 * to disk. So "a refused turn leaves the record exactly as it was" is still exactly
 * true, and turn.db.test.ts still proves it.
 *
 * WHAT STILL GUARANTEES ONE WRITER PER FOUNDER, now that the lock cannot span the
 * run. Three things, and each covers what the others cannot:
 *
 *   1  THE LOCAL GATE, withFounderGate below. One turn per founder in this process,
 *      end to end. This is the one that protects the FOLDER, and it is the right
 *      place for it: /tmp/ge/<id> belongs to this process, the queue and the live
 *      session map are already in memory on one Reserved VM, and a second turn now
 *      waits on a promise instead of waiting on a lock while holding a connection.
 *      That second half is the other half of the old deadlock.
 *   2  THE ADVISORY LOCK, in T1 and again in T2. Still transaction scoped, still
 *      safe through a pooler, still "one writer per founder, across containers", now
 *      held for milliseconds at each end instead of for the length of a model run.
 *   3  THE VERSION CHECK IN T2. The plan is computed against the folder materialise
 *      built from founder.version as it was in T1. If that version moved while the
 *      model was running, some other writer committed and the plan describes a state
 *      the record no longer has. T2 refuses with turn_superseded and rolls back
 *      rather than overwriting. This is the belt that makes the split safe even if
 *      assumption B6 turns out to say more than one container runs.
 *
 * The one thing lost is that a second container's turn now discovers the conflict
 * after its run instead of waiting before it. It costs that turn its work and the
 * founder is told to send again, with their data untouched. That is the correct
 * trade against an app that stops.

 *   4  the version check             refuses a turn another writer has overtaken
 *   5  plan the harvest              hash everything, refuse an unexplained absence
 *   6  the rules gate                rules 1 to 5 over what the model wrote
 *   7  drop what the gate held       the held paths come out of the plan
 *   8  apply the harvest             the first line in this list that touches ge_file
 *   9  bump version, refresh track   only when something actually changed
 *  10  ge_event
 *  11  COMMIT
 *
 * STEP 6 SITS WHERE IT DOES ON PURPOSE. Before it, nothing has been written to
 * ge_file; after it, everything has. Move it one line down and an artifact with a
 * banned word in it is already stored when the gate speaks, and the gate becomes a
 * report on a thing that already happened.
 *
 * STEP 7 IS WHY A HELD FILE IS REALLY HELD. gateHarvest returning normally means
 * the TURN may commit. It does not mean every file may be saved. Everything below
 * step 7 reads the narrowed plan and nothing reads the wide one, which is what
 * makes the next two paragraphs true without a single extra condition:
 *
 *   applyHarvest never sees the held path, so ge_file never gets a row for it.
 *   brainTouched is computed from the narrowed plan, so a held founder-brain.md
 *   cannot move founder.track or founder.route. The column is a cache of the file,
 *   and pointing it at a Brain that was not saved would break rule 1 at its anchor.
 *
 * STEP 4 IS NEW AND IT IS WHAT PAYS FOR THE SPLIT. The plan below is computed
 * against a folder materialise built from `versionBefore`. If the founder's version
 * moved while the model was running, another writer committed and this plan is
 * describing a state the record no longer has. Committing it would silently
 * overwrite that writer's work. Refusing costs this turn and keeps both.
