 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The tests for the one place the browser talks to our server.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Two promises live in this file and both are invisible until the day they matter.
 *
 * Nothing throws. A rejected fetch on venue wifi, a 500 with an HTML error page from a
 * proxy, a 204 with no body at all: every one of them has to come back as an answer the
 * screen can render, because an exception here is a white page in front of a founder.
 *
 * And it fails closed. The server half of this app is being written at the same time as
 * this half, so a route that does not exist yet answers 404. A 404 must become "this part
 * is not connected yet", never an empty list, because an empty list reads as "you have no
 * files" and that is the one thing this app must never say to somebody who has work.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. It replaces the global fetch for the length of a test and puts
 * the real one back afterwards.
