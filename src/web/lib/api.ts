/**
 * src/web/lib/api.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * Every call the browser makes to our own server, and the shape of every answer. One file.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Three failures.
 *
 * The first is a screen that lies. `fetch` rejects on a dropped connection and resolves on
 * a 500, so the naive version of this code shows a founder a spinner forever when the
 * server said no. Every function here returns an answer or a problem, never a throw, and
 * every problem carries a sentence a non technical person can act on. That is what makes
 * "never a spinner with no explanation" enforceable rather than a good intention.
 *
 * The second is drift between the two halves of the app, which are being written at the
 * same time by different people. The routes this file names are the contract. Where
 * `planning/REPLIT-BUILD.md` names a path, the path here is that one and the section is
 * cited. Where it does not, the name is ours and is marked ASSUMED, so a mismatch is found
 * by reading one file rather than by a founder pressing a button.
 *
 * The third is failing open. A route that does not exist yet answers 404, and a 404 here
 * becomes `not_built_yet`, which the screens render as a plain sentence saying that part is
 * not connected. It never becomes an empty list that reads as "you have no files".
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * Every screen in src/web/routes and nothing else. Components take data as props.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Reads and writes the app's own HTTP API on the same origin. It holds no state and no
 * credential: the session is an HttpOnly cookie the browser attaches by itself, which is
 * why no token is ever in JavaScript reach on this side.

 * these two functions gets called, never a field or a query string riding along on one
 * shared call — `contract.test.ts` reads this file for the addresses the browser asks
 * for, and it can only see a literal string, not a destination built at runtime.
 *
 * `warnings` and `truncated` are read off a 201 and are the server's own account of what it

 * the founder has said, at upload time, that the file is a writing sample of theirs.
 *
 * A LITERAL STRING, NOT A VARIABLE, AND THAT IS NOT STYLE. `contract.test.ts` reads this
 * file's own text for the addresses the browser calls, by matching a quoted literal
 * directly inside a `postForm(...)` call; a path built from a shared variable is invisible
