 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The tests for the small decisions the token walk makes.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The token shape check is a guess, inferred from our own shell and never
 * compared against a real GoHighLevel token. A guess that blocks a founder at 10pm is worse
 * than no check at all, so the test that matters is that it is only ever a warning, and
 * that the walk still moves on. The rest holds the walk in one order.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing.
