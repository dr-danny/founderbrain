 * src/web/lib/setup-rail.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The tests for the setup checklist and the GoHighLevel failure copy.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Two things have to hold for three weeks of September. A founder who has
 * done everything currently possible must be told they are done, not shown a bar that says
 * 40 percent. And a B2C founder must have no Apollo row, no Apollo skip, and no Apollo
 * anywhere.
 *
 * The failure copy is asserted against the content file character for character. The
 * instruction on this build is that the strings live in `app/content/ghl-walk.ts` and are
 * used, not rewritten in the components, and a test is the only thing that keeps that true
 * after somebody edits a screen in a hurry.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing.
