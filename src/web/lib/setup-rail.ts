/**
 * src/web/lib/setup-rail.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The setup checklist as data: which rows exist for this founder, what state each is in,
 * which of the two finish lines each belongs to, and what the screen should say. Also the
 * one function that turns a GoHighLevel failure into the words the founder reads.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Three failures.
 *
 * One, the half finished progress bar. Onboarding goes out on 4 September and the cohort
 * buys GoHighLevel together at the clinic on 23 September, so for nearly three weeks the
 * honest state of most founders is "everything you can do is done". Setup has two finish
 * lines, ready to start and ready to publish, and this file knows which row belongs to
 * which. Showing 40 percent to somebody who has done everything currently possible is how
 * you teach 130 people to ignore the progress bar.
 *
 * Two, the other track's material. The Apollo row does not exist for a B2C founder. Not
 * greyed out, not skipped, not mentioned. `apolloRowExists` in track.ts is the only test,
 * and it is applied here, once, where the rows are built, so no screen can add it back.
 *
 * Three, a failure with no next click. Every GoHighLevel failure maps to a row of the table
 * in `app/content/ghl-walk.ts`, which carries the cause in plain words and one action. The
 * mapping is here so a screen cannot invent its own wording for a state the copy already
 * covers.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * The Setup screen and the token walk screens.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Nothing. Pure functions over the setup response and the founder.
