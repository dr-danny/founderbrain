 * src/web/routes/Apollo.tsx
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The two ways to get 25 contacts and 25 opening lines into a sequence.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * How Apollo connects is genuinely unknown. Today it is OAuth through a Claude connector,
 * and server side there is no client to run that OAuth. So there is a primary and a
 * guaranteed fallback, and the fallback ships either way: the app produces the contacts and
 * the first lines as a spreadsheet, and the founder uploads it themselves. That is not a
 * consolation prize. The pre work docs already treat the manual path as first class with no
 * apology, and twenty five messages is a number a person can handle by hand, which is
 * exactly why an unverified integration is survivable here.
 *
 * RULE 3 IS IN THE COPY. Twenty five is the number, it is low volume on purpose, and
 * nothing on this screen predicts a reply. Not a rate, not a range, not a hint. Replies
 * depend on the list, the offer and the timing, and promising one is the fastest way to
 * lose a founder's trust in week two.
 *
 * RULE 1 IS IN WHO CAN SEE IT. This screen exists for B2B founders. app.tsx checks
 * `apolloRowExists` before it renders, so a B2C founder who lands on this address gets the
 * "not one of yours" answer and never reads the word.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * app.tsx, on `#/setup/apollo`, and only for a B2B founder.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Reads the setup state. The spreadsheet is a plain download link.

          people, get their addresses, and build your sequence in your Apollo account. It builds it paused, and
