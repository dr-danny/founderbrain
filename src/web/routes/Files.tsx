 * src/web/routes/Files.tsx
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * Everything a founder has made. The list, one file open on screen, and the downloads.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Rule 4, and this screen is the whole of it. On a laptop the founder had a folder they
 * could open, copy and keep. On a server they have this, and if it is incomplete or hard to
 * read then their work is not really theirs, whatever the database contains.
 *
 * Three things follow, and each is here because leaving it out is the usual way this goes
 * wrong. Every file has its own download, so nobody has to take the whole folder to get one
 * file. There is one button that takes everything, because a founder who wants to leave
 * with their work should not have to click nineteen times. And the internal folder is shown
 * rather than hidden, behind a disclosure labelled in plain words, because a folder we hide
 * is a folder they do not own.
 *
 * A FOURTH THING FOLLOWS NOW: what a founder attached to a message from inside the chat,
 * via the Composer, is not the app's own work and is shown as its own section, not folded
 * into the list the app wrote. It is first class, the same as everything else here, so it
 * is never behind a disclosure the way `.state/` is.
 *
 * THE LINE ABOUT THE CHECK IS DELIBERATE, AND SO IS ITS PLACE. `src/server/rules/` reads
 * every file before it is saved and holds one that breaks a rule. It is a word matcher, so
 * it misses things, and a founder who believes it is a guarantee will send something without
 * reading it. Saying that plainly is cheaper than the alternative, which is a founder finding
 * out from a prospect. It sits on this screen and not on first run because this is where a
 * founder stands when they are about to use a file, and first run promises two questions in
 * thirty seconds.
 *
 * IT NAMES NEITHER TRACK'S TACTICS, WHICH IS RULE 1. The two specifics worth knowing, cold
 * DMs and unbacked numbers, are in `docs/PRE-WORK.md` in the content repo, which a founder
 * reads before the Brain forks them. Putting Instagram on a screen a B2B founder opens every
 * day would be showing them the other track's material.
 *
 * RULE 1. The rows are filtered by track here as well as on the server. `ge index` already
 * forks on the Track line, so in the ordinary case every row that arrives is theirs. This
 * filter is what makes a bug on the other side of the wire show up as a missing row rather
 * than as the other track's material on their screen.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * app.tsx, on `#/files` and `#/files/<name>`.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Reads the file index and one file's text. Downloads are plain links, so the browser does
 * the saving and no JavaScript sits between a founder and their own file.
