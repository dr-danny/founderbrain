 * src/web/routes/Thread.tsx
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The conversation. One engine, one thread, streamed answers, a stop button, and the list
 * of files the engine has written while the founder watched.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * This is the app. Everything else is the way in and the way back out.
 *
 * Four things it has to get right, all of them named in section 4.
 *
 * Input and output are separate connections on purpose. Sending is an ordinary POST that
 * comes back in under 50 ms with a turn id and streams nothing. Output arrives on an SSE
 * connection that has been open since before the send. A dropped output stream therefore
 * cannot lose an accepted message, and a reconnect replays what was missed from the id the
 * browser last saw.
 *
 * Stop is not a cancel. The partial text that already streamed is kept, and the founder can
 * read what they stopped.
 *
 * The file panel updates as writes happen, because a founder watching their Founder Brain
 * appear is the moment the product feels real. It is free: the frames are already on the
 * stream.
 *
 * RULE 1. A route this founder cannot see cannot be opened here either, whatever address
 * they arrived on. A mentor pasting the wrong link, or a founder editing the address bar,
 * gets a plain sentence and a way back, not the other track's engine.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 * app.tsx, on `#/thread/<routeId>`.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES
 * Opens the thread, sends messages, interrupts, and holds the SSE connection open. All of
 * it through lib/api.ts and lib/stream.ts. It also reads the storage limits, once, to tell
 * the composer's paperclip how big a file it can accept; a failed read of that leaves the
 * hover line out rather than touching anything else on the screen.
