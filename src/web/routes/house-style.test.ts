/**
 * src/web/routes/house-style.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * Every screen rendered, and its words put through the project's own house style rules.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * The writing rules for anything a founder reads are not a preference. No em dashes or en
 * dashes, ranges written as "11 to 13", no marketing language, and nothing anywhere that
 * promises a reply. `scripts/validate.sh` enforces them on the files a human wrote in the
 * content repo, and `src/server/rules/prose.ts` enforces them at runtime on what a model
 * wrote. Neither of them can see this folder, because the copy here is neither: it is
 * written into components and rendered in a browser.
 *
 * So this test renders the screens and runs the same rules over the result. The banned word
 * list is lifted from `validate.sh` by the rule module, not typed out again here, so the
 * three places these rules are enforced cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The reply promise check earns its place on its own. Rule 3 says B2B outreach is 25 low
 * volume messages and that nothing we ship promises replies, because replies depend on the
 * list, the offer and the timing. The Apollo screen is exactly where somebody would
 * eventually write "expect two or three replies", and this is what stops it.
 *
 * THREE SCREENS WERE MISSING, AND ADDING THEM NEEDED A FIXTURE FIRST.
 * Files, Gates and FirstRun were not in SCREENS. FirstRun shows everything it has from its
 * props, so it simply goes in. Files and Gates fetch in `useEffect`, and React runs no
 * effects when it renders to a string, so adding them as they stand renders the waiting
 * state and nothing else: 31 characters for Files, 293 for Gates. Both pass the rules, and
 * they pass without reading one word of the screen a founder sees. That is coverage in name
 * only, and it is worse than none, because the row in the list claims the screen is checked.
 *
 * So `loadedScreen` below renders them with their data in. It runs the component's own
 * effect, lets its own `fetch` call resolve against a stubbed answer, and renders again with
 * what came back. No component is changed, and no copy is retyped here.
 *
 * AND THE FIXTURE IS ITSELF CHECKED. A harness that quietly stopped working would put the
 * waiting state back through the rules and stay green. The last test asserts that each
 * loaded screen carries words that exist only in its loaded state, so the day the harness
 * breaks it says so instead of going quiet.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. The rule module reads `scripts/validate.sh` from the content
 * repo once. `loadedScreen` replaces `globalThis.fetch` while it runs and puts it back.
 * Nothing is written, and nothing opens a socket.

/**
 * React's current hooks dispatcher.
 *
 * `useState` and `useEffect` are one line each inside the React package: they look this up
 * and call it. `react-dom/server` puts its own in for the length of a render, and its
 * `useEffect` does nothing, which is right for a server and is exactly why a screen that
 * fetches renders empty here.
 *
 * SO THE COMPONENT IS CALLED AS A FUNCTION, WITH A DISPATCHER OF OUR OWN, and the element
 * tree it returns is then handed to `react-dom/server` in the ordinary way. Only the top
 * level component's own hooks go through the one below. Every child renders as it always
 * did.
 *
 * IT IS A REACT INTERNAL, AND IT IS NAMED LIKE ONE. That is worth the one place it is used:
 * the alternative is a screen a founder reads and no test does. If React moves it, the
 * assertion below fails at import and says so, rather than this file quietly going back to
 * checking 31 characters.
