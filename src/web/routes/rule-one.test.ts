 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * Rule 1, asserted against the words that actually reach the screen.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Every other guard in this app is a function that could be called correctly and rendered
 * around. These tests render the real screens and read the text back, so what is asserted
 * is what a founder would see. The assertions are negative on purpose: they name the words
 * from the other track's programme and require that none of them appear. Negative
 * assertions survive rewording, and rewording is what happens to this copy between now and
 * September.
 *
 * The Apollo case is the sharpest one. Section 6 says the word does not appear anywhere in
 * a B2C founder's app, not even as a skip line saying it is not needed on their track,
 * because a skip line is still the other track's material on their screen.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing. Nothing here touches the network: these screens take
 * their data as props, and React does not run effects when it renders to a string.
