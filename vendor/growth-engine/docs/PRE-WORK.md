# Pre-work: do this now

Sent 4 September. Everything here must be done before Session 1 in the week of 7 September.

Two of these items are time-critical and cannot wait for the first session. They are marked.

**This is only the app.** Apollo, GoHighLevel and your sending domain are set up with us, in the sessions where you use them. [docs/SESSIONS.md](SESSIONS.md) is what happens when.

You are setting up one thing: your own copy of the Launchhouse app. It runs in your browser, it holds your work for you, and nobody else can see inside it. Setting it up takes about twenty minutes and needs no technical knowledge. It does need a card.

## 1. Get a GitHub account

Go to github.com and sign up. It is free and it takes two minutes.

This is where your copy of the app lives. Replit reads it from there, and later on Claude can look inside it for you if you want to understand or change anything.

Use the email address you will bring to Atlanta.

## 2. Take your own copy of the app

Open **https://github.com/Philm-moxywolf/launchhouse-app**. You are looking at our copy of the app.

Press **Fork**, near the top right. Confirm it.

That makes your own copy, in your own GitHub account, and it is yours from that moment. Nothing you do to it affects ours, and nothing we do to ours changes yours until you ask for it.

Ten seconds.

## 3. Get a Replit account

The app runs on Replit. Go to replit.com and sign up. You need the **Core** plan.

**Do not pay for it yet.** Oneday is on Replit's partner programme, so we can get you Core for free. Ask in Slack before you put a card in. It is 20 USD a month if you buy it yourself.

You need the paid plan because the free one cannot keep an app running on its own, and yours has to stay up between sessions.

Sign up on the same email address, and stay on it. Your work lives in this account.

## 4. Bring your copy into Replit

Go to **https://replit.com/import**.

Connect your GitHub account when it asks. Then **pick your fork out of the list it shows you.** You forked it a minute ago, so it will be near the top. There is no URL to find and nothing to paste.

That gives you your own running app. Not a shared login, not an account on our system: your app, your database, and nobody else can see inside it.

## 5. Answer Replit's assistant

Replit brings your copy in using an assistant that talks to you while it works. This is Replit's, not ours, and it asks questions before it finishes. That is normal and it is not a sign anything is wrong.

Three things to know:

- **If it offers to get the app running, say yes.**
- **It will ask you to choose a project passphrase.** That passphrase is how you get into your app, and it is the only way in. Make it at least twelve characters and put it in your password manager while you are looking at it. We cannot reset it for you. It is in your account, not ours.
- **It usually creates your database at the same time.** You do not have to ask it to.

Answer in plain words. It is reading a file inside your copy that tells it what this app needs, so it already knows most of it.

## 6. When it says it has finished, ignore what it suggests next

Replit's assistant signs off by offering you follow-up tasks. Adding an API key is a common one. So is fixing timezone and deployment checks.

**Do not click any of them.** They are Replit's generic suggestions and they are not steps in this programme.

The API key goes into the app instead, at step 8. That takes ten seconds and it checks the key actually works, which Replit's version does not. The timezone and deployment settings are already correct in your copy, because they are written into the files you forked.

Following those suggestions costs an evening and changes nothing.

## 7. Check the database and the passphrase

Two things have to be true before you can sign in. The assistant has usually done both already, so this is a look rather than a job.

To find them, open the **Tools** menu, above the preview window. They are not down the left.

- **Database.** There should be a Postgres database. If there is not, create one. It is one button, and the app finds it on its own and sets itself up the first time it starts.
- **Secrets.** There should be a secret called `OWNER_PASSPHRASE`. If the assistant asked you for a project passphrase, this is where it went and you are done. If it is missing, add it now, at least twelve characters.

Without the database the app will tell you it cannot sign you in yet.

## 8. Start it and sign in

Press **Run**, wait for it to finish starting, and sign in with your passphrase.

**Work in the preview window inside Replit.** That is where this app is meant to be used and where we will be looking when we help you.

If anything is missing, the first screen tells you what and what to do about it. It is written to be read by somebody who has never done this before.

## 9. TIME-CRITICAL: add your Anthropic API key

Inside the app, go to **Setup** and paste an Anthropic API key.

Get one at console.anthropic.com. This is not the same thing as a Claude subscription, and having one does not give you the other. It is billed by usage, and you will need to put a small amount of credit on it, around 20 USD to start.

**Paste it into the app, not into Replit's settings, and not into the task Replit's assistant offered you at step 6.** Replit can store keys for you and a key kept there works. What it does not do is check the key. Pasting it into the app asks Anthropic two questions first: is this a real key, and does this account have credit on it. The second one is the one that catches a key that looks perfect and does nothing.

Do this before Session 1. Without it the app can hold your work but cannot write anything, and that is the whole of Session 1.

## 10. Check you are ready

In the app, open **Home**. It shows you every engine and what state it is in.

If it says you are set up and have not started yet, you are done. Stop there. We build the rest together in Session 1.

If something is wrong, the app says so on that screen, in words, with the next step. If that does not fix it, post in the Slack channel. Do not lose an evening to it.

## How you use it, in one paragraph

There are no commands to remember and nothing to install on your computer. Home lists the engines in order. You open one, it asks you questions, you answer in your own words, and it writes files for you. Everything it writes appears under **Files**, where you can read it or download it at any time. You never choose a folder and there is nothing to keep in one place.

If you get stuck mid conversation, say so in your own words. It is a conversation, not a form.

## If you pick the wrong track

You choose B2B or B2C once, in the Founder Brain, and every step after it is built for that side. Most people know which they are. A few change their mind once they see what each side actually produces.

It is fixable. Open the Founder Brain and say:

> change my track

That reopens the Brain on that one line and nothing else. Answer it, and everything after it switches side.

Two things to know before you do.

**Your old work is not deleted.** It stays where it is. It stops showing in your Files list, because that list only shows the track you are on. Switch back and it returns.

**The new track starts from nothing.** The two tracks produce different files, so what you already have does not carry across.

If you are unsure which you are, ask in the Slack channel before Session 1 rather than guessing and switching later.

## 11. TIME-CRITICAL if you sell to consumers

Convert your Instagram to a Business or Creator account and link it to a Facebook Page.

Two minutes. Nothing publishes or captures inbound without it.

## 12. Collect your pictures and clips. Start now, finish before Atlanta

This is the one people leave and then cannot fix on the day.

The engine writes you 30 pieces of content. It writes the words. **It cannot film your workshop or photograph your product.** If you turn up with nothing, you get 30 posts you cannot publish, and no amount of writing fixes that on the Friday.

Start collecting from Session 1. Have it done before you travel.

### Where it goes

**Your GoHighLevel Media Library.** Not your phone, not a folder on your laptop, not a Google Drive.

That is where posts are published from, so a picture anywhere else has to be moved before it can be used. Put it in once and it is ready. The app can see what is in there, so it will write posts around the clips you actually have rather than inventing a shot list you never asked for.

You set GoHighLevel up in Session 2, on 14 or 15 September. Until then, keep what you shoot somewhere you can find it and move it across in one go.

Upload as you go after that. Twenty minutes a week beats an evening in September.

### If you sell to consumers

Your track is the visual one, so this is the bigger ask. Roughly:

| What | How many | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Short clips | 12 | 20 to 40 seconds each. Filmed upright, on your phone. Good light, no editing needed |
| Photos | 20 | A mix of upright and landscape. Your work, your product, your place, you |
| Your logo | 1 | PNG with a transparent background if you have one |

Twelve clips is one afternoon. Talk to the camera about one thing at a time: a question you get asked a lot, something you fixed, how you do a thing differently. You are not performing. You are explaining.

Twenty photos, most people already have. If you do not, take them in one go.

### If you sell to businesses

Much lighter, because your posts are mostly words and LinkedIn does not need a picture to work.

| What | How many | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A photo of you | 1 | A decent one. It goes on the profile people check before replying |
| Your logo | 1 | PNG with a transparent background if you have one |
| Screenshots or photos of the work | 5 to 10 | Optional, and useful for the longer posts. A dashboard, a result, a before and after |

If you only do the first one, you are fine. The other two make a handful of posts better.

### Also worth keeping, both tracks

Anything you have already written and published. Old posts, a newsletter, a page of your website, an email you were pleased with.

This is the one thing the engine cannot generate and cannot do without: **it is how it learns to sound like you rather than like a machine.** Founders who arrive with nothing they have written get content that reads like everybody else's.

## Costs, so nothing surprises you

Only the first three are needed before Session 1. The rest arrive in the session where you actually use them, which is deliberate: nobody sets a tool up three weeks early and still remembers how it works.

| What | When | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Replit Core | **Before Session 1** | **Free.** Ask in Slack and we sort it through Oneday's partner programme. 20 USD/month otherwise. Runs your app |
| Keeping your app running | **Before Session 1** | From 15 USD/month. Set at the size your app needs when you publish it, and we do this together |
| Anthropic API credit | **Before Session 1** | Billed by what you use. Put roughly 20 USD on to start and top it up when it runs low |
| A domain, B2B only | Session 1 | Roughly 15 USD/year. You can buy it through Apollo in the session, which is the simplest route because it connects itself |
| Apollo, B2B only | Session 1 | Free to start. The 65 USD/month plan comes in Session 2, when you set up sending |
| GoHighLevel Starter | Session 2 | 97 USD/month plus usage |
| Claude paid plan | Session 3 | Monthly. This is the one you will use every day afterwards |

Two of those need saying plainly rather than being left in a table.

**The API credit is not a subscription.** It is a balance that goes down as you use it. If the app stops working mid session, that is the first thing to check.

**GoHighLevel is your CRM, your social publishing and your automation.** Required for both tracks, and set up together in Session 2. Buy the plan rather than starting a trial: a trial started in September expires during the weekend you need it.

## Updates

We will improve the app during the programme, and updates are not automatic.

Because your copy is a fork on GitHub, taking an update means pulling our newer version into your fork, then into Replit. When there is one worth taking, we will post the exact steps in Slack.

**It never touches your work.** Your Brain, your content and everything else live in your database, not in the code. Updating the app is like updating any other app on your phone: the thing changes, your stuff does not.

Do not go looking for updates on your own. Take them when we say, so that a room of 130 people is running the same thing.

## Read it before you send it

There is a check built in, and it is worth knowing what it is and what it is not.

Everything written for you is read once before it is saved. Most of the time you will never know it ran. When it does have something to say, it says it in one of two ways, and the difference is whether the file is in your Files list.

**A note.** The file is saved and you get a line beside it. Something like a flat marketing word, or a number the check could not match to anything in your Founder Brain. Read it or ignore it. Nothing has been taken away.

**Held back.** The file is not saved, and you are told which file, which line and what to do next. Everything else from the same request is saved as normal. This is rare and it is kept for the two mistakes below.

It catches the obvious mistakes. It does not catch everything, and it was never built to. So read your own content before you send it to anybody. That has not changed and it will not.

Two mistakes cost more than the rest, so know these yourself rather than trusting a check to find them.

**Never automate cold DMs on Instagram.** Sending opening messages to people who have not messaged you first gets accounts restricted, and a restricted account is not something you can undo later. Yours go out by hand, from your own account, spread out. The automation you do get sits on the inbound side, after somebody has come to you.

**Never let a number you cannot back up reach a buyer.** If somebody asks where a figure came from, the answer has to be something you said. If a number is real, put it in your Founder Brain so it is on the record. If it is not, take it out.

Your own writing is never checked. Your voice samples and the words you type yourself are yours, and nothing holds them back or edits them.

If something is held and you are sure it is fine, ask for that one file again. If it still will not go through, ask a mentor or post in Slack.

## Stuck

Post in the Slack channel. Do not wait for the session.
