# init.sh: create and anchor the founder's working folder. Sourced by ge.sh.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS: everything the toolkit writes goes in one folder, and the
#                folder has to exist and know where it is before any skill runs.
#                The anchor is what lets every later command tell "you are in
#                the wrong folder" apart from "you have not started yet", which
#                are the two states founders confuse most often.
# CALLED BY:     ge init, the setup skill, and every skill that finds no folder
# READS:         growth-engine/.state/HOME   WRITES: growth-engine/ and everything seeded in it
# POSTURE:       fail-closed on the anchor. If the anchor cannot be written the
#                folder is not usable and saying so now beats failing later.
#                Fail-closed on a second folder too: ge init will not make one
#                while another already exists, because that is the state in
#                which every other verb refuses and none of them can be fixed
#                from inside
# PORTABILITY:   POSIX sh. No bash/python/node/jq.
# EVERY ERROR MESSAGE ENDS WITH A RECOVERY LINE ("→ run: ...").
#
# WHAT "→ run:" PROMISES HERE
#
# Everything after "→ run: " is the command, to the end of the line. A founder
# selects the whole line and pastes it, so nothing else may ride on it: no
# comma, no "then ge init again", no "and carry on there". Every one of those
# used to, and pasted whole they hand the shell a command it does not have.
# What the founder needs to know goes on its own line above, and the step that
# used to be described in English is joined on with && instead, so one paste
# leaves the folder made. Two states have no command ge can stand behind, both
# marked where they are written: they get "→ " and an instruction, with no
# "run:", so the pasteable form means pasteable every time.
#
# WHY IT RE-ANCHORS, AND WHEN IT WILL NOT
#
# ge init is the command the doctor names when the anchor and the folder
# disagree, so it has to be able to settle that disagreement. It could not: it
# kept any anchor file that already existed, so a founder who dragged their
# folder from Downloads to the Desktop was told to run ge init, ran it, was told
# it worked, and got the same red line for ever. Moving a folder is the most
# ordinary thing anybody does with one, and on Windows the machine does it for
# them when OneDrive backs up the Desktop.
#
# The anchor cannot tell a folder that MOVED from a folder that was COPIED. Both
# look the same from inside. What tells them apart is the place the anchor names:
#
#   it is gone                 the folder moved. Re-anchor. Nothing else exists,
#                              so there is nothing to lose and one command fixes it.
#   it is the same folder      one folder, two names, which is what an alias, a
#   under another name         mapped drive, or a Mac reaching /tmp as
#                              /private/tmp gives you. Re-anchor to the name the
#                              founder actually used today.
#   it still holds a folder    this one is a copy. Two folders now hold work.
#                              Re-anchoring would quietly make the copy the real
#                              one, so ge stops and names both instead.
#
# HOW A FOUNDER DELIBERATELY MOVES THEIR FOLDER
#
# Move it, then run ge init from where it is now. That is the whole procedure,
# it is two steps, and every refusal here that needs it prints it.
#
# WHAT IT DOES INSIDE A growth-engine FOLDER
#
# It works on that folder. It used to make growth-engine/growth-engine, silently,
# and every later command then wrote into the empty new one while the founder's
# real work sat one level up. init's own closing line tells founders to always
# open this same folder, which is exactly what puts them inside it.

# What the anchor line will say, worked out before anything is written so a
# refusal happens before the folder is touched.
GE_INIT_ACT=create                      # create, keep or update
GE_INIT_WHY=''                          # gone, or renamed, when the act is update
GE_INIT_WAS=''                          # the path the anchor used to name

# ge_init_no_write <the file that would not be written>: one recovery line for
# every file ge init writes, and a command to paste wherever ge can name what
# refused. The folders are made by mkdir further down, which has its own answer.
#
# WHY: the lines this replaced described an action instead of naming one.
# "check the folder is not read only" left the founder to work out which folder
# and which command, and "ge init from a folder you can write to" was worse than
# that, because by the time a seed file fails the folder here is already made and
# already anchored, so running ge init somewhere else meets the refusal about a
# second folder instead of a way out.
#
# The file is asked about before the folder, because a sync client locks the one
# file it is holding and leaves the folder around it alone. When neither is the
# thing in the way ge cannot name it, and a chmod on something already writable
# helps nobody, so what is handed over is the command that looks at the disk.
#
# The chmod used to be followed by ", then ge init again", which is the two
# steps written out for somebody who is reading rather than pasting. Pasted, the
# shell reads chmod's arguments as a list of files and one of them is the word
# "then". So the second step is joined on with && and the line does both.
# ge_init_mode <a folder that refused a write>: the chmod that is enough for it.
#
# WHY: making a folder, or a file inside one, needs the search bit as well as the
# write bit. A folder that has lost both, as a sync client can leave the folder a
# founder is standing in, stays shut after chmod u+w, and the same refusal comes
# back from the line that was meant to clear it. Linux can still name that folder
# where a Mac cannot, so this is where the difference showed. u+w is kept for the
# folder that only lost its write bit, because that is the whole answer there.
