# ge.sh: the dispatcher. Every brain subcommand enters here.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS: one entry point means one place that resolves the founder's
#                folder, one place that loads the libraries, and one place where
#                an unknown verb produces a useful answer instead of a traceback.
# CALLED BY:     bin/ge, which is what lands on PATH
# READS:         scripts/lib/*.sh   WRITES: nothing itself, subcommands own their files
# POSTURE:       fail-open on help and context, fail-closed on every write path.
#                Loading is fail-closed too: a file of ge's own that is missing,
#                unreadable or half written is answered with a sentence, because
#                the dot command is a special built-in and a shell that trips
#                over one ends there with nothing said.
#                A reader who stops early is not a failure. Every line a founder
#                reads on the screen is written by a child, so a pipe closed by
#                head, by grep -q or by a pager the founder quit ends that child
#                quietly and ends the run at zero.
# PORTABILITY:   POSIX sh. No bash/python/node/jq. BSD+GNU date via lib/date_compat.sh.
# EVERY ERROR MESSAGE ENDS WITH A RECOVERY LINE ("→ run: ...").

# that line has been given something that cannot run and cannot be made to.
#
# So the surface says, and only the surface knows. Set GE_INVOCATION in the
# environment and it is used exactly as given. Set nothing and a pinned folder
# is taken as the answer on its own, because a pin is set by something that

# because catching the signal is the very thing that turns the death into a
# reported error, and it adds the same complaint to dash, which was silent. A
# child holds none of our traps, so it ends on the signal itself, silently, and
# hands back 141. head, grep -q and a pager the founder quit all close the pipe
# early, the skills do it, and none of them is a fault. The command path below

ge, the Launchhouse brain. Everything it writes lives in your growth-engine folder.

Start here
  ge init                 make your growth-engine folder. Safe to run again
  ge context              a short summary of where your work stands
  ge check                checks your folder and shows what it found
  ge help                 this page

Your work
  ge log <type> "<text>"  add one line to your ops log
  ge remember <kind> ...  add one line to your curated memory
  ge person <verb> ...    the people you are selling to
  ge ledger <verb> ...    your content pieces
  ge receipt <verb> ...   the record of what your setup checks found
  ge accounts <verb> ...  the social accounts you can post to

Going back
  ge snapshot <file>      keep a copy of one file before you change it
  ge restore <file>       put an older copy of that file back
                          more than one copy, and it lists them for you to pick
  ge undo                 undo the last change ge made to one of your files

Keeping it tidy
  ge index                rebuild the table of which files are ready
  ge lint                 warnings about the shape of your files. It changes nothing

Used by the skills
  ge version              which version of the toolkit you have
  ge invocation           the line a skill uses to call ge

Six of these do more than one thing. Type one on its own, for example ge person,
and it prints its own list: log, remember, person, ledger, receipt and accounts.

If something looks wrong, start with ge check.
