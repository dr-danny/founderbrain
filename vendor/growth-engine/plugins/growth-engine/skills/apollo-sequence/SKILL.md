description: For B2B founders on the Apollo route. Builds the list of 25 through the founder's Apollo connector from their written criteria, shows the credit cost before any enrichment, records each person, hands back for first lines, then creates the sequence in their Apollo account with the copy in it, paused, with the 25 added. Never starts or sends it. Trigger on "build my Apollo sequence", "find my 25", "build my list in Apollo", "put my sequence into Apollo", "load my outreach into Apollo".

# Apollo sequence

Takes the founder's outreach engine into their own Apollo account.

**The line that does not move.** The sequence is built **paused**. Starting it is a button the founder presses in Apollo, having read the messages. Nothing here starts it, sends a message, or buys anything. The Launchhouse checks stop those tools in this folder anyway.

**Who is reading.** A founder who does not use a terminal. Never ask them to run a command.

## 0. Before starting

1. **Check the folder.** Read the session context. If it says this is not the founder folder, stop and tell them which folder to open.
2. **Read the Brain.** Read `./growth-engine/founder-brain.md`. If it does not exist or has no Track line, say in one plain sentence that the sequence is built from their Founder Brain and outreach engine, and offer to build the Brain with them now. If they say yes, follow the `founder-brain` skill, then come back here. If not now, give them the one next step: `/growth-engine:brain`, or say "build my founder brain".
3. **Check the track.** If `Track` is `b2c`, stop. Apollo is not part of the B2C track. Send them to `/growth-engine:audience`.
4. **Check the sequence exists.** Read `growth-engine/outreach-sequence.md`.
   - If it does not exist, the sequence and criteria come first, because this step loads the founder's own words and never writes a sequence of its own. Offer to build them with the outreach engine now (`/growth-engine:outreach`), then come back here.
   - If it records the manual route (Microsoft 365 or other), stop. Their route is by hand, and `outreach-firstlines.csv` is their checklist. Offer to switch routes only if their work email has changed to Google.
5. **When something is missing or thin.** If something this step needs is missing or thin, do not guess and do not stop. Ask for it, one question at a time, and say in a few words why you are asking. Make it easy to answer: a sentence in their own words, a pick from two or three options you suggest, something they already wrote pasted in, a file added with `/growth-engine:add-files`, or "not sure yet", which you note as a gap and work around. Never suggest a number, a result or a customer: those only ever come from them. If what they tell you belongs in the Brain, say so, and that "update my brain" puts it there.
6. **Check Apollo is connected.** You need tools whose names end in `apollo_mixed_people_api_search` and `apollo_sequences_create`. If not, run `/growth-engine:connect`.

**Credits.** Whenever a tool's response includes an `mcp_credits` block, tell the founder the estimated cost before the spend, and the credits used and balance after. Always, unprompted.

## 1. Build the list, free

**First, bring in first lines from the app.** If `growth-engine/outreach-firstlines.csv` has a row whose email has no person file, write one for it, named by the slug of the email, in the prospect shape in `../../references/contract.md`. Set `key` and `email` to the address, with `kind: prospect`, `status: candidate`, `source: import`, `created` today, and `first_name` and `company` from the row. Put the row's `first_line` inside the Opener block. Never change a person file that already exists. **Then skip this step** if `growth-engine/people/` holds 25 or more prospects not at `cut`, and go to step 3. If it holds fewer, count the ones already there towards the 35 and the 25.

1. **Search.** Use the tight criteria from `outreach-sequence.md` with the tool ending `apollo_mixed_people_api_search`.
   - Search does not spend credits.
   - It returns a catalogue: names with the surname hidden, titles and companies, and whether an email is likely. No email addresses.
2. **Widen if needed.** If tight returns fewer than 35 good matches, add medium, then broad. Say which you used.
3. **Show about 35 candidates** as a short table: first name, title, company, and why they fit the criteria. Never invent a detail.
4. **Cut to 30 with the founder.** They cut the ones that are not a fit on a second look. This is the outreach engine's "build to 35, cut to 25", done in two steps: the 5 kept over 25 cover addresses that will not verify, and the last cut to 25 happens after enrichment.

## 2. Enrich, only with a yes

Enrichment finds each person's email address, and **it spends the founder's Apollo credits**.

1. **Say the cost.** Say how many people, and the credit cost the tool estimates. Count only the new candidates: anyone who already has a person file with an email is never enriched again.
2. **Ask:** "This uses about <n> of your Apollo credits. Shall I get the addresses for these <n>?"
3. **Wait for a clear yes.**
4. **Enrich.** Use the tool ending `apollo_people_bulk_match`, or `apollo_people_match` one at a time.
   - Never ask for personal emails or phone numbers. Work email only.
5. **Report the spend:** the credits used and the balance left.

For each person with a work email, write a person file in `growth-engine/people/`, named by the slug of their email, in the prospect shape in `../../references/contract.md`:
- `kind: prospect`
- `status: candidate`
- `source: apollo`
- `email`, `first_name`, `name`, `company`, `title`
- `email_status`: `valid` only when Apollo says the address is verified, otherwise `unverified`
- `apollo_contact_id`, if one came back

If a file with that name already exists, leave it exactly as it is. That person is already on the list, so do not count them twice.

People with no address, or an address Apollo marks as not deliverable, get `status: cut` and a note saying why.

If more than 25 remain, go through them with the founder and cut to 25. Cut people keep their file at `status: cut`, never deleted.

## 3. First lines

Every person not at `cut` needs a first line in the Opener block of their file.

**Keep the lines that exist.** They are the founder's, from the outreach engine or from the app. A line exists if it is in the person's Opener block, or in their row of `outreach-firstlines.csv`, which is where the app wrote them. If the block is empty and the CSV has a line, copy that line into the block exactly as it is. Never rewrite one while loading.

If any are missing, write them now, following Step 4 of the outreach engine exactly:
- one line specific to that company or person, from real detail
- a generic honest line when there is nothing specific
- in the founder's voice, from the Voice section of the Brain and their own writing in `voice-samples/`
- batches of 5 to 10, so the founder can check as they go

Use the `voice-reviewer` agent on the first batch you write, and change what it flags before writing the rest.

Then rewrite `growth-engine/outreach-firstlines.csv` from the people not at `cut`, in the contract's shape. Every line already in the file for someone not at `cut` stays exactly as it was.

Use the `rules-reviewer` agent on `outreach-firstlines.csv` before loading anything.

## 4. Load into Apollo

**Check the mailbox first.** Call the tool ending `apollo_email_accounts_index`. If no mailbox is connected, stop here and tell them to connect the one they will send from in Apollo. Nothing can go into a sequence without it. Everything so far is saved, so they carry on from this step once it is connected.

Before each call, read the tool's own parameters and use them as they are. **Never guess at a field it does not list.** If a tool cannot do what a step needs, stop, tell the founder the one thing to do by hand in Apollo, and carry on from there.

### The first line field

1. Call the tool ending `apollo_fields_index`, and look for a contact custom field called `first_line`.
2. If there is none, ask the founder to create it: in Apollo settings, custom fields, a new contact field named exactly `first_line`, as long text. Wait until they say it is done, then check again.
3. Say why the name matters: the CSV column, the Apollo field and the sequence variable all read `first_line`, and a mismatch fails silently.

### Contacts

Only contacts go into sequences.

1. **Show the plan.** Say: "I will add these 25 as contacts in your Apollo account, each with their first line."
2. **Wait for a yes.**
3. **Create.** Use the tool ending `apollo_contacts_bulk_create`, or `apollo_contacts_create` one at a time, with de-duplication on if the tool offers it.
   - Set `first_line` on each contact.
   - **If the create tool cannot set a custom field,** set it afterwards on each contact with the tool ending `apollo_contacts_update`.
   - **If neither can,** tell the founder to import `outreach-firstlines.csv` in Apollo and map the `first_line` column to the field. Wait until they have.
4. **Label them.** With the tools ending `apollo_labels_create` and `apollo_labels_add_entity_ids_to_label_names`, add a label `Launchhouse 25`, so the list is easy to find.
5. **Record the ids.** Write each `apollo_contact_id` into the person file.

### The sequence

1. **Read the copy.** Read the touches from `outreach-sequence.md`: subject lines, bodies with the `{{contact.first_name}}`, `{{account.name}}` and `{{first_line}}` variables, wait intervals, and the same-thread decisions. The personal line goes into touch 1 as `{{first_line}}`, exactly.
   - **These are the founder's words, in their voice, and they go in as written.** Never shorten, polish or rewrite a touch while loading it. The sequence was written and approved in the outreach engine, whether in this folder or in the app.
   - If a file from the app writes the personal line some other way, such as `[first line]`, change only that marker to `{{first_line}}`, and show the founder the line before and after.
   - If a touch has no opt-out line, or there are fewer than four touches, stop. Send them back to the outreach engine to finish the sequence there, rather than writing touches here.
2. **Pick the schedule.** Call the tool ending `apollo_emailer_schedules_index`, and choose a weekday business-hours schedule in the founder's timezone. Confirm it with them.
3. **Show the plan.** Say: "I will create the sequence <name>, paused, with <n> touches, sending from <mailbox> on <schedule>. Nothing sends until you press start in Apollo."
4. **Wait for a yes.**
5. **Create it** with the tool ending `apollo_sequences_create`, **inactive**.
   - If the tool can set the steps and copy, set them exactly as written.
   - If it cannot, create the sequence, then tell the founder to paste each touch from `outreach-sequence.md` into the steps in Apollo, in order, with the waits. Offer to show each touch for copying.
6. **Read it back.** Call the tool ending `apollo_emailer_campaigns_show`, and check it is not active, the steps match, and stop-on-reply is on. If stop-on-reply is off, tell them to turn it on in the sequence settings.

### Add the 25

1. **Ask:** "Add the 25 to the paused sequence, sending from <mailbox>?"
2. **Wait for a yes.**
3. **Add them.** Use the tool ending `apollo_emailer_campaigns_add_contact_ids`, with the mailbox's id as the sending account.
4. **Update each person file.** Set `status: enrolled`, and add a touch line `- YYYY-MM-DD email out: added to the paused Apollo sequence`.

## 5. Hand it to the founder

Tell them, in this order:

1. The sequence is in Apollo, paused, with 25 people and their first lines.
2. Before starting it, open it in Apollo and read every step as one of the 25 would see it. Check the first line shows up in the preview.
3. Check open and click tracking are off in the sequence settings.
4. Starting it is their button, in Apollo. Nothing here will press it.

Never promise replies. If they ask what to expect, say replies depend on the list, the offer and the timing, and the plan tracks what happens rather than predicting it.

## 6. Save

1. Add a line to `ops-log.md`: `- HH:MM result: Apollo sequence <name> built paused with 25 contacts`.
2. Run `git add growth-engine` then `git commit -m "Apollo sequence built, paused"`. Person files stay out of git. Push if there is a remote.

## Afterwards

When the founder asks how it is going:
- Call the tool ending `apollo_emailer_campaigns_activity_feed` or `apollo_emailer_messages_search`, and report what it returns: sent, bounced, opted out, replied.
- Never compare against a reply rate nobody gave you.
- Replied people become `status: replied` in their file.

When someone asks to be left alone, stop them straight away with the tool ending `apollo_emailer_campaigns_remove_or_stop_contact_ids`, after telling the founder, and set their status to `stopped`.
