description: Build or update the Founder Brain, the single locked record of a founder's business, audience, offer, proof, and writing voice. Every other engine reads it, so it comes before any content, outreach, audience, or operations work. Trigger on "build my founder brain", "set up my brain", "build my brain", "update my brain", "change my track", or whenever another engine reports that no founder-brain.md exists. If the folder has not been set up yet, run the start skill first.

# Founder Brain

The Founder Brain is the input to every other engine. Nothing else runs without it.

Output is a single file at `./growth-engine/founder-brain.md` in the founder's Launchhouse folder.

**Where the work lives.** Every file this makes sits in the `growth-engine/` folder inside the folder the founder opened, and it is saved with git as you go, so any earlier version can be brought back. The same folder works in Cowork. Say this once, near the end: open this same folder every time.

**Who is reading.** A founder who does not use a terminal. Never ask them to run a command. Run what needs running yourself.

## Before starting

1. **Check the folder.** Read the session context at the top of the conversation. If it says this is not the founder folder, stop and tell them which folder to open instead. If the folder is not set up, run the `start` skill first.
2. **Check for an existing Brain.** Look for `./growth-engine/founder-brain.md`. Most founders already have one, built in Session 1 and brought across from the Launchhouse app.
   - **It does not exist:** run the full intake below.
   - **It exists and they asked to update it:** go straight to the part they want to change. Never re-run the full intake for an update.
   - **It exists and they asked to build a new one:** show a three-line summary of the one they have, and ask whether to update it or start again.
   - **They asked to change track:** follow the section below.
3. **In any update, check the Brain has what the gates and engines read:** a Locked date, a Track line, `## Thesis`, `## Voice` and `## Numbers`. If one is missing, say so and offer to add it in the same sitting. A missing Thesis fails Gate A. For `## Numbers`, fill each line from what the Brain already says in Proof, Stage and Goal, and ask only for what is not there.

**The Locked date** is the day the Brain was first written. An update keeps it.


### If they ask to change the track

"change my track" is a trigger on this skill, so a founder asking has reached the right place. It is allowed. Do not tell them it cannot be done, and do not send them to a mentor. There is no escalation path and inventing one leaves them stuck.

It is the one change that costs a founder work, so it takes one honest exchange first. That is not the same as refusing.

**Say what it costs, using their own file names.** Everything built off the track was written for the other side. Their Brain stays, their voice profile stays, and the rest is rebuilt.

**Ask what changed.** Not to talk them out of it. "I picked wrong in session 1" is answered differently from "I want to serve schools as well as parents". The second one usually wants `hybrid: true` and the same track, and that distinction is worth thirty seconds of asking.

**If they confirm, do it.** Reopen only the parts that fork on the track: the Model question (B2C only), the audience capture and the channel questions. Each is asked differently on each side, and the intake below already knows which. Everything else in the file is still true, so do not re-ask it and do not re-run the full intake.

Then change the file **in one write**:
- the Track line, and the Model line (add it for B2C, remove it for B2B)
- `## Audience` and `## Channels`, from the new answers
- any line elsewhere, most often in `## Flags` or `## Channels`, that names the old track's method: the sending domain, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, cold email, an ICP or firmographics, LinkedIn prospecting or an outreach sequence for B2B; the Instagram account type, a hook bank or DM openers for B2C. Rewrite it for the new track, or mark it resolved.

Then read the Thesis, Offer and Proof back to them in one message and ask whether they still hold for the new buyer. Change only what they say has changed.

The Launchhouse checks read the whole Brain against its Track line, so a Brain that says b2c but still describes cold email is held and put back. One write with everything changed is what saves.

**Then say what to expect.** Their old track's files stay in the folder, but nothing reads, lists or builds on them any more. The new track's gates start empty. Name which files they now need and which session covers each. Their 30 content pieces were written for the old buyer, so offer to rebuild them for the new one with the content engine's refill mode, which keeps the old batch as an archive.

If they are hesitating, leave it where it is. They can come back to it, and a track changed twice costs more than a track changed once.

## Intake

Ask these in small groups, not all at once. Three or four questions per turn. Reflect back what you heard before moving on. This should feel like a conversation with a sharp consultant, not a form.

**Say where they are, every single turn.** Open each group by naming the stage and the count, like `Part 2 of 6: the track fork`. The six are the business, the track fork, the audience, the offer and proof, the channels, then the voice. When you finish the last one, say you are writing the file.

A founder who cannot see the end of a conversation does not know whether to give a quick answer or a careful one. The ones who guess wrong give thin answers early, then run out of patience at the voice, which everything else is built on. One line per turn fixes that.

### Group 1: the business

1. What is the business called, and what does it sell?
2. Who pays you? Be specific about the actual buyer.
3. What stage are you at? Pre-revenue, first customers, under 10k a month, 10 to 50k, above 50k.
4. What do you charge, and how? One-off, subscription, retainer, per unit.

### Group 2: the track fork

This is the most important question in the intake. Everything downstream branches from it.

Ask: **does your revenue come mostly from selling to other businesses, or to individual consumers?**

- Mostly businesses, so B2B
- Mostly consumers, so B2C
- Genuinely both

If they say both, do not create a third track. Ask which motion produces more revenue today, or which one they most want to grow over the next 90 days. Record that as `track`, and record `hybrid: true` alongside it. The hybrid flag adjusts tone and examples later, and it gives them the Hybrid GoHighLevel snapshot. It does not create a third track.

Explain briefly why you are asking: the outreach engine works completely differently on each track, and getting this wrong means building the wrong machine.

**If track is B2C**, ask one more question: do they sell a service people book, or products people buy from a shop? Record the answer as `Model`, either `service` or `ecommerce`. It shapes their content, and it guides which pack of their operations snapshot they publish first. Never ask this of a B2B founder.

### Group 3: audience

**If track is B2B**, capture the ICP:
- What kind of company? Industry, size, revenue band, geography.
- Who is the individual you actually sell to? Job title, seniority, department.
- What triggers them to start looking for something like yours?
- Which companies are your best-fit customers today? Name three.

**If track is B2C**, capture the persona:
- Who is this person? Age range, life stage, situation.
- What do they want that they cannot get right now?
- Where do they already spend attention online? Be specific about platforms and accounts.
- What do they already buy that sits next to your product?

Do not ask B2B questions of a B2C founder or the reverse. It wastes their time and signals the tool does not understand them.

### Group 4: offer and proof

1. What problem do you solve, in one sentence, in their words rather than yours?
2. Why you rather than the obvious alternative?
3. What proof do you have? Results, numbers, named customers, case studies, testimonials, credentials.
4. What do you want more of in the next 90 days? Leads, sales, followers, retention.

**Ask question 3 in their world, not in business language.** Most founders here run small local businesses, so the countable things are dogs, weddings, kitchens, boilers, meals, sessions, callouts and repeat bookings, not customers and firms. Ask how many they have done, how long they have been doing it, how many come back, and which one went best. Write the numbers down exactly as they said them, and write unknown where they do not know.

That last part is the important one. A number recorded here is a number every other engine is allowed to use. A gap recorded here is a gap nothing downstream will quietly fill in for them.

Proof matters more than founders expect. It is the raw material for every post and every message. If they have none, say so plainly and note it, because the content engine will lean on story and point of view instead.

### The thesis

From their Group 4 answers, compose one sentence: who they serve, the problem in the customer's own words, and why them rather than the obvious alternative. Read it back and adjust until they would say it out loud to a stranger. This is the thesis. It goes in the Brain, and it is part of their Gate A submission.

### Group 5: channels

- Where do you currently publish, if anywhere?
- Which channels do you have accounts on but do not use?
- **If track is B2C**: is your Instagram a personal account, or Business or Creator? If personal, tell them to convert it now, because publishing and inbound capture will not work without it, and it takes two minutes.
- **If track is B2B**: which provider is their work email on, Google (Gmail or Google Workspace), Microsoft 365, or something else? This decides how they send their 25 messages later, so record it plainly. It is not a technical question to them: "what do you open your work email in" gets the answer.
- **If track is B2B**: do you have a business domain with real email sending history, or will you need a fresh domain? A fresh domain needs SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured now, plus ten to twenty real messages a day between now and Atlanta. At 25 messages, correct setup matters more than months of warmup, but it cannot be crammed into the last week, so flag it as a start-today item.

## Voice capture

Three paths. Pick based on what they have. Nobody gets stuck here.

**Important distinction before you start.** The voice must be theirs. Curated content from other people is useful for working out what to write *about*, never for how it sounds. If you train the voice on a competitor, the founder ends up publishing something that reads like an imitation, and their audience can tell. Topics can be borrowed. Voice cannot.

### Path A: they have writing

Ask for 10 to 20 samples of anything they have written in their own voice. Posts, emails, newsletters, even long messages. They can paste them in, or drop them into `growth-engine/voice-samples/` from Finder, File Explorer or Cowork. Save anything pasted as its own file in `growth-engine/voice-samples/`, one piece per file, named after its first few words.

Two folders hold what a founder gives you. `growth-engine/voice-samples/` holds their own writing. Read these for voice, and you may add to this folder yourself. `growth-engine/uploads/` holds reference documents they supplied. Read them for facts, topics and context, never for voice, because they may be AI-generated or written by somebody else.

Read them and extract:
- Sentence length and rhythm
- Vocabulary level and any recurring words or phrases
- How they open and how they close
- Whether they use humour, and what kind
- First person singular or plural
- How direct they are, and how much they hedge
- Formatting habits: lists, line breaks, questions, emoji

### Path B: they have some writing, but not much

Five or six real samples is enough to work from. Read them the same way as Path A, then fill the gaps with two or three interview questions from Path C. Say plainly that a smaller sample is fine and that you will check the result with them before anything gets built on it.

### Path C: they have nothing written

Many early-stage and B2C founders have no body of writing. This is normal. Do not make it awkward.

Run a short interview instead, and capture how they *speak*:
- Tell me about the last customer you really enjoyed working with.
- What do people get wrong about your industry?
- What would you say to someone about to make the mistake your product prevents?
- What is the thing you find yourself explaining over and over?

Their answers to these are the voice sample. Pay attention to how they actually phrase things, not what they say.

### Source material, all three paths

Separately from voice, ask what they already read and who they follow in their space. Competitors, industry accounts, newsletters, creators. This is not for voice. It is so the content engine knows what conversations their audience is already having, and what the founder wants to agree with or argue against.

Record five to ten of these in the Brain under Source material. A founder with a strong point of view and no writing history will produce better content from this than a founder with fifty posts and nothing to react to.

### Voice profile

Either path produces the same output: a description specific enough that another writer could imitate it. Include three or four verbatim phrases they actually use.

Then show the founder a two-sentence sample written in their captured voice and ask: does this sound like you? Adjust until they say yes. Do not skip this check.

## Writing the file

Write `./growth-engine/founder-brain.md` in this shape:

```markdown
# Founder Brain

- **Founder:**
- **Business:**
- **Track:** b2b | b2c
- **Model:** service | ecommerce, B2C only, leave out for B2B
- **Hybrid:** true | false
- **Stage:**
- **Locked:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Thesis
One sentence: who they serve, the problem in the customer's words, why them.

## Offer
What they sell, how it is priced, the problem it solves in customer language, and why them.

## Audience
B2B: ICP firmographics, buyer persona, trigger events, three named best-fit accounts.
B2C: persona, desire, attention map, adjacent purchases.

## Proof
Results, numbers, named customers, testimonials, credentials, and the plain counts from their own diary or invoices, written as they said them. Note explicitly if thin, and write unknown rather than guessing.

## Goal, next 90 days

## Channels
Active, dormant, and account status. Note IG account type for B2C, domain status and work email provider (Google, Microsoft 365, other) for B2B.

## Numbers
Labelled lines the 90 day plan projects from. Customers now, average monthly value, target in 90 days. Take them from what the founder said in Proof, Stage and Goal where they already said it, and write unknown only where they do not know.

## Source material
Five to ten accounts, competitors, newsletters or feeds their audience already reads. Topics only, not voice.

## Voice
Description of how they write or speak, plus three or four verbatim phrases.

## Flags
Anything the mentor team needs to know. Thin proof, no list, personal IG, fresh domain, unclear offer.
```

The Flags section is what the mentor team reads before the session. Be honest in it. A brain that hides a problem is worse than one that names it.

## Check and save

Before showing the founder anything:

1. **Check it.** Use the `rules-reviewer` agent on `growth-engine/founder-brain.md`. Give it every number and claim the founder said in this conversation, quoted as they said it, as the figures the founder gave.
2. **Fix what it holds.** A held line is usually a number the founder did not give. Ask them about it rather than guessing: "you mentioned roughly 40 jobs a month, is that right?" Write their answer, or write unknown. Do this at most twice. If something is still held, show it to the founder and let them decide.
3. **Save it.** Run `git add growth-engine` then `git commit -m "Founder Brain locked"`, or "Founder Brain updated" for an update. If `git remote -v` shows a remote, run `git push`. If the push fails, say the work is saved on this computer and move on.

If a write is held by the Launchhouse checks while you are writing the file, the message says which line and why. Fix that line and write the file again. Never tell the founder about a check in technical terms.

## After writing

1. Show the founder a short summary and confirm it is right.
2. Tell them the Brain is now locked and every other engine reads from it. Locked means nothing rewrites it behind their back. It does not mean it can never change, and if they ask later they are not being difficult.
3. For a new Brain, tell them their Gate A submission is ready whenever they want it: `/growth-engine:gate`.
4. Tell them what happens next, based on track:
   - **B2B**: if the domain is fresh, set up SPF, DKIM and DMARC today and start sending ten to twenty real messages a day. Correct setup beats long warmup at 25-message volume, but it needs the weeks between now and Atlanta, not the last one.
   - **B2C**: convert Instagram to Business or Creator today, and link it to a Facebook Page.

Both of those are time-critical and founders will forget. Say them last so they are the thing remembered.
